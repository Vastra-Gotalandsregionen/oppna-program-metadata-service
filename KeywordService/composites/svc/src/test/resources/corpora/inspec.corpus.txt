<doc><title>Novel active noise-reducing headset using earshell vibration control varying from aviation communication to consumer audio. Current ANR systems use passive attenuation at high frequencies and loudspeaker-based active noise control at low frequencies to achieve broadband noise reduction. This paper presents a novel ANR headset in which the external noise transmitted to the user's ear via earshell vibration is reduced by controlling the vibration of the earshell using force actuators acting against an inertial mass or the earshell headband. Model-based theoretical analysis using velocity feedback control showed that current piezoelectric actuators provide sufficient force but require lower stiffness for improved low-frequency performance. Control simulations based on experimental data from a laboratory headset showed that good performance can potentially be achieved in practice by a robust feedback controller, while a single-frequency real-time control experiment verified that noise reduction can be achieved using earshell vibration control</title><text>Active noise-reducing (ANR) headsets are available commercially in applications</text><keywords>active noise-reducing headset;earshell vibration control;aviation communication;consumer audio;passive attenuation;broadband noise reduction;force actuators;inertial mass;velocity feedback control;piezoelectric actuators;stiffness;robust feedback controller;single-frequency real-time control</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>The impact of the Internet on public library use: an analysis of the current consumer market for library and Internet services and resources of public libraries is an issue of critical importance. The research reported in this article provides baseline data concerning the evolving relationship between the public's use of the library and its use of the Internet. The authors developed a consumer model of the American adult market for information services and resources, segmented by use (or nonuse) of the public library and by access (or lack of access) to, and use (or nonuse) of, the Internet. A national Random Digit Dialing telephone survey collected data to estimate the size of each of six market segments, and to describe their usage choices between the public library and the Internet. The analyses presented in this article provide estimates of the size and demographics of each of the market segments; describe why people are currently using the public library and the Internet; identify the decision criteria people use in their choices of which provider to use; identify areas in which libraries and the Internet appear to be competing and areas in which they appear to be complementary; and identify reasons why people choose not to use the public library and/or the Internet. The data suggest that some differentiation between the library and the Internet is taking place, which may very well have an impact on consumer choices between the two. Longitudinal research is necessary to fully reveal trends in these usage choices, which have implications for all types of libraries in planning and policy development</title><text>The potential impact of the Internet on the public's demand for the services</text><keywords>Internet;public libraries;baseline data;consumer model;American adult market;national Random Digit Dialing telephone survey;decision criteria;public library;longitudinal research</keywords></doc>

Using tools from statistical mechanics we are able to identify phase transitions in the structure of the solution space and to connect them to the changes in the performance of a global algorithm, namely Gaussian elimination. Crossing phase boundaries produces a dramatic increase in memory and CPU requirements necessary for the algorithms. In turn, this causes the saturation of the upper bounds for the running time.

<doc><title>On optimality in auditory information processing the primary part of the mammalian auditory system using a stochastic Fitzhugh-Nagumo model and an action-recovery model for synaptic depression. Our overall model covers the chain from a hair cell to a point just after the synaptic connection with a cell in the cochlear nucleus. The information processing performance of the system is evaluated using so-called phi -divergences from statistics that quantify "dissimilarity" between probability measures and are intimately related to a number of fundamental limits in statistics and information theory (IT). We show that there exists a set of parameters that can optimize several important phi -divergences simultaneously and that this set corresponds to a constant quiescent firing rate (QFR) of the spiral ganglion neuron. The optimal value of the QFR is frequency dependent but is essentially independent of the amplitude of the signal (for small amplitudes). Consequently, optimal processing according to several standard IT criteria can be accomplished for this model if and only if the parameters are "tuned" to values that correspond to one and the same QFR. This offers a new explanation for the QFR and can provide new insight into the role played by several other parameters of the peripheral auditory system</title><text>We study limits for the detection and estimation of weak sinusoidal signals in</text><keywords>weak sinusoidal signals;mammalian auditory system;stochastic Fitzhugh-Nagumo model;action-recovery model;peripheral auditory system;quiescent firing rate;spiral ganglion neuron</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>A humanist's legacy in medical informatics: visions and accomplishments of Professor Jean-Raoul Scherrer how his humanist vision, medical skills and scientific background have enabled and shaped the development of medical informatics over the last 30 years. Starting with the mainframe-based patient-centred hospital information system DIOGENE in the 70s, Prof. Scherrer developed, implemented and evolved innovative concepts of man-machine interfaces, distributed and federated environments, leading the way with information systems that obstinately focused on the support of care providers and patients. Through a rigorous design of terminologies and ontologies, the DIOGENE data would then serve as a basis for the development of clinical research, data mining, and lead to innovative natural language processing techniques. In parallel, Prof. Scherrer supported the development of medical image management, ranging from a distributed picture archiving and communication systems (PACS) to molecular imaging of protein electrophoreses. Recognizing the need for improving the quality and trustworthiness of medical information of the Web, Prof. Scherrer created the Health-On-the Net (HON) foundation. These achievements, made possible thanks to his visionary mind, deep humanism, creativity, generosity and determination, have made of Prof. Scherrer a true pioneer and leader of the human-centered, patient-oriented application of information technology for improving healthcare</title><text>The objective is to report on the work of Prof. Jean-Raoul Scherrer, and show</text><keywords>Professor Jean-Raoul Scherrer;Medical Informatics;medical image management;PACS;man-machine interfaces;data mining;natural language processing</keywords></doc>

A speed control scheme having two-degree-of-freedom (2DOF) structure is developed here to improve the speed dynamic response of an SRM drive. In the proposed control scheme, the feedback controller is quantitatively designed to meet the desired regulation control requirements first. Then a reference model and a command feedforward controller based on an inverse plant model are employed to yield the desired tracking response at nominal case. As the variations of system parameters and operating conditions occur, the prescribed control specifications may not be satisfied any more. To improve this, the inverse model is adaptively tuned by a fuzzy control scheme so that the model-following tracking error is significantly reduced. In addition, a simple disturbance cancellation robust controller is added to improve the tracking and regulation control performances further</title><text>Quantitative and robust speed control for a switched reluctance motor (SRM)</text><keywords>quantitative speed control;SRM drive;fuzzy adapted inverse model;switched reluctance motor;nonlinear dynamic behavior;speed dynamic response;regulation control requirements;reference model;command feedforward controller;inverse plant model;tracking response;system parameters;operating conditions;control specifications;fuzzy control scheme;model-following tracking error</keywords></doc>

Individual words were fragmented in eight levels using Turbo Pascal, and the resulting program was implemented on a PC microcomputer. The words were presented individually to a group of 40 Spanish observers, using a controlled time procedure. An unspecific learning effect was found showing that performance improved due to practice with the task.

<doc><title>Controller performance analysis with LQG benchmark obtained under closed loop conditions (LQG) benchmark in terms of the variances of process input and output from closed-loop data, for assessing the controller performance. LQG benchmark has been proposed in the literature to assess controller performance since the LQG tradeoff curve represents the limit of performance in terms of input and output variances. However, an explicit parametric model is required to calculate the LQG benchmark. In this work, we propose a data driven subspace approach to calculate the LQG benchmark under closed-loop conditions with certain external excitations. The optimal LQG-benchmark variances are obtained directly from the subspace matrices corresponding to the deterministic inputs and the stochastic inputs, which are identified using closed-loop data with setpoint excitation. These variances are used for assessing the controller performance. The method proposed in this paper is applicable to both univariate and multivariate systems.

<doc><title>Time-varying properties of renal autoregulatory mechanisms autoregulation, time-frequency and time-scaling methods were applied to renal blood flow under broad-band forced arterial blood pressure fluctuations and single-nephron renal blood flow with spontaneous oscillations obtained from normotensive (Sprague-Dawley, Wistar, and Long-Evans) rats, and spontaneously hypertensive rats. Time-frequency analyses of normotensive and hypertensive blood flow data obtained from either the whole kidney or the single-nephron show that indeed both the myogenic and tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) mechanisms have time-varying characteristics. Furthermore, we utilized the Renyi entropy to measure the complexity of blood-flow dynamics in the time-frequency plane in an effort to discern differences between normotensive and hypertensive recordings. We found a clear difference in Renyi entropy between normotensive and hypertensive blood flow recordings at the whole kidney level for both forced (p < 0.037) and spontaneous arterial pressure fluctuations (p < 0.033), and at the single-nephron level (p < 0.008). Especially at the single-nephron level, the mean Renyi entropy is significantly larger for hypertensive than normotensive rats, suggesting more complex dynamics in the hypertensive condition. To further evaluate whether or not the separation of dynamics between normotensive and hypertensive rats is found in the prescribed frequency ranges of the myogenic and TGF mechanisms, we employed multiresolution wavelet transform. Our analysis revealed that exclusively over scale ranges corresponding to the frequency intervals of the myogenic and TGF mechanisms, the widths of the blood flow wavelet coefficients fall into disjoint sets for normotensive and hypertensive rats. The separation of the scales at the myogenic and TGF frequency ranges is distinct and obtained with 100% accuracy. However, this observation remains valid only for the whole kidney blood pressure/flow data. The results suggest that understanding of the time-varying properties of the two mechanisms is required for a complete description of renal autoregulation</title><text>In order to assess the possible time-varying properties of renal</text><keywords>time-varying properties;Long-Evans rats;whole kidney;single-nephron;Renyi entropy;spontaneous arterial pressure fluctuations;hypertensive rats;normotensive rats;renal autoregulatory mechanisms;broad-band forced arterial blood pressure fluctuations;single-nephron renal blood flow;spontaneous oscillations</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>Combining spatial and scale-space techniques for edge detection to provide a spatially adaptive wavelet-based noise filtering algorithm domains are proposed. A priori knowledge about geometrical characteristics of edges is used to assign a probability factor to the chance of any pixel being on an edge. An improved double thresholding technique is introduced for spatial domain filtering. Probabilities that pixels belong to a given edge are assigned based on pixel similarity across gradient amplitudes, gradient phases and edge connectivity. The scale-space approach uses dynamic range compression to allow wavelet correlation over a wider range of scales. A probabilistic formulation is used to combine the results obtained from filtering in each domain to provide a final edge probability image which has the advantages of both spatial and scale-space domain methods. Decomposing this edge probability image with the same wavelet as the original image permits the generation of adaptive filters that can recognize the characteristics of the edges in all wavelet detail and approximation images regardless of scale. These matched filters permit significant reduction in image noise without contributing to edge distortion. The spatially adaptive wavelet noise-filtering algorithm is qualitatively and quantitatively compared to a frequency domain and two wavelet based noise suppression algorithms using both natural and computer generated noisy images</title><text>New methods for detecting edges in an image using spatial and scale-space</text><keywords>scale-space techniques;edge detection;spatially adaptive wavelet-based noise filtering algorithm;a priori knowledge;geometrical characteristics;probability factor;double thresholding technique;spatial domain filtering;pixel similarity;gradient amplitudes;gradient phases;edge connectivity;dynamic range compression;wavelet correlation;probabilistic formulation;final edge probability image;adaptive filters;approximation images;matched filters;image noise;spatially adaptive wavelet noise-filtering algorithm;noise suppression</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>The use of the SPSA method in ECG analysis signals recorded of a single patient over a relatively long period of time is considered. The particular application we have in mind is high-resolution ECG analysis, such as late potential analysis, morphology changes in QRS during arrythmias, T-wave alternants, or the study of drug effects on ventricular activation. We propose to apply a modification of a classical method of cluster analysis or vector quantization. The novelty of our approach is that we use a new distortion measure to quantify the distance of two ECG cycles, and the class-distortion measure is defined using a min-max criterion. The new class-distortion-measure is much more sensitive to outliers than the usual distortion measures using average-distance. The price of this practical advantage is that computational complexity is significantly increased. The resulting nonsmooth optimization problem is solved by an adapted version of the simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA) method of J. Spall (IEEE Trans. Automat. Contr., vol. 37, p. 332-41, Mar. 1992). The main idea is to generate a smooth approximation by a randomization procedure. The viability of the method is demonstrated on both simulated and real data.

<doc><title>Computational capacity of an odorant discriminator: the linear separability of curves probabilistic receptor affinity distribution model of olfaction. Our system consists of N sensory neurons whose outputs converge on a single processing linear threshold element. The system's aim is to model discrimination of a single target odorant from a large number p of background odorants within a range of odorant concentrations. We show that this is possible provided p does not exceed a critical value p/sub c/ and calculate the critical capacity alpha c=p/sub c//N. The critical capacity depends on the range of concentrations in which the discrimination is to be accomplished. If the olfactory bulb may be thought of as a collection of such processing elements, each responsible for the discrimination of a single odorant, our study provides a quantitative analysis of the potential computational properties of the olfactory bulb.

<doc><title>Library services today and tomorrow: lessons from iLumina, a digital library for creating and sharing teaching resources library of instructional resources, iLumina, in which the contributors of resources and the users of those resources are the same-an open community of instructors in science, mathematics, engineering, and technology. Moreover, it is not the resources, most of which will be distributed across the Internet, but metadata about the resources that is the focus of the central iLumina repository and its support services for resource contributors and users. The distributed iLumina library is a community-sharing library for repurposing and adding value to potentially useful, mostly non-commercial instructional resources that are typically more granular in nature than commercially developed course materials. The experience of developing iLumina is raising a range of issues that have nothing to do with the place and time characteristics of the instructional context in which iLumina instructional resources are created or used.

The new areas of knowledge management and learning organisations offer substantial promise as imperatives for the organisation of business enterprises. As organisations in the contemporary environment adopt knowledge-based structures to improve their competitive position, there is value in examining these structures against other performance related factors. Theoretical knowledge-based structures put forward by R. Miles et al. (1997) and J. Quinn et al.

<doc><title>Noninvasive myocardial activation time imaging: a novel inverse algorithm applied to clinical ECG mapping data insufficient performance when it comes to estimating the activation time map on the surface of the heart from electrocardiographic (ECG) mapping data. Additional regularization has to be considered leading to a nonlinear problem formulation. The Gauss-Newton approach is one of the standard mathematical tools capable of solving this kind of problem. To our experience, this algorithm has specific drawbacks which are caused by the applied regularization procedure. In particular, under clinical conditions the amount of regularization cannot be determined clearly. For this reason, we have developed an iterative algorithm solving this nonlinear problem by a sequence of regularized linear problems. At each step of iteration, an individual L-curve is computed. Subsequent iteration steps are performed with the individual optimal regularization parameter. This novel approach is compared with the standard Gauss-Newton approach. Both methods are applied to simulated ECG mapping data as well as to single beat sinus rhythm data from two patients recorded in the catheter laboratory. The proposed approach shows excellent numerical and computational performance, even under clinical conditions at which the Gauss-Newton approach begins to break down</title><text>Linear approaches like the minimum-norm least-square algorithm show</text><keywords>noninvasive myocardial activation time imaging;activation time imaging;Gauss-Newton approach;individual optimal regularization parameter;catheter laboratory;clinical conditions;iteration steps;regularization procedure;inverse algorithm;clinical ECG mapping data</keywords></doc>

This model applies a bionics approach to describe the interaction between the pedestrians using ideas from chemotaxis. Here we study a rather simple situation, namely the evacuation from a large room with one or two doors. It is shown that the variation of the model parameters allows to describe different types of behaviour, from regular to panic. We find a non-monotonic dependence of the evacuation times on the coupling constants. These times depend on the strength of the herding behaviour, with minimal evacuation times for some intermediate values of the couplings, i.e., a proper combination of herding and use of knowledge about the shortest way to the exit</title><text>We present simulations of evacuation processes using a recently introduced</text><keywords>chemotaxis;coupling constants;herding behaviour;bionics-inspired cellular automaton model;pedestrian dynamics</keywords></doc>
<doc><title>Absorption of long waves by nonresonant parametric microstructures possibility of designing an active absorbing (nonreflecting) coating in the form of a thin layer with small-scale stratification and fast time modulation of parameters. Algorithms for space-time modulation of the controlled-layer structure are studied in detail for a one-dimensional boundary-value problem. These algorithms do not require wave-field measurements, which eliminates the self-excitation problem that is characteristic of active systems. The majority of the considered algorithms of parametric control transform the low-frequency incident wave to high-frequency waves of the technological band for which the waveguiding medium inside the layer is assumed to be opaque (absorbing). The efficient use conditions are found for all the algorithms. It is shown that the absorbing layer can be as thin as desired with respect to the minimum spatial scale of the incident wave and ensures efficient absorption in a wide frequency interval (starting from zero frequency) that is bounded from above only by a finite space-time resolution of the parameter-control operations. The structure of a three-dimensional parametric "'black" coating whose efficiency is independent of the angle of incidence of an incoming wave is developed on the basis of the studied one-dimensional problems. The general solution of the problem of diffraction of incident waves from such a coating is obtained. This solution is analyzed in detail for the case of a disk-shaped element</title><text>Using simple acoustical and mechanical models, we consider the conceptual</text><keywords>mechanical models;nonreflecting coating;thin layer;small-scale stratification;fast time modulation;space-time modulation;controlled-layer structure;one-dimensional boundary-value problem;parametric control;low-frequency incident wave;high-frequency waves;waveguiding medium;absorbing layer;angle of incidence;one-dimensional problems;diffraction;disk-shaped element</keywords></doc>

For second order systems this drawback is eliminated by using the moving switching line technique where the switching line is initially designed to pass the initial conditions and is subsequently moved towards a predetermined switching line. In this paper, we make use of the above idea of moving switching line together with the reaching law approach to design a discrete output feedback sliding mode control. The main contributions of this work are such that we do not require to use system states as it makes use of only the output samples for designing the controller. and by using the moving switching line a low sensitivity system is obtained through shortening the reaching phase.

The highly irregular shapes of the nuggets and the packing constraints make this a difficult and challenging task. It requires the delicate manipulation and packing of highly irregular polycrystalline silicon nuggets into a fragile fused silica crucible. For this application, a dual optical 3-D surface mapping system that uses active laser triangulation has been developed and successfully tested. One part of the system measures the geometry profile of a nugget being packed and the other the profile of the nuggets already in the crucible. A resolution of 1 mm with 15-KHz sampling frequency is achieved. Data from the system are used by the packing algorithm, which determines optimal nugget placement. The key contribution is to describe the design and implementation of an efficient and robust 3-D imaging system to map highly irregular shaped objects using conventional components in context of real commercial manufacturing processes</title><text>The basic technology for a robotic system is developed to automate the packing</text><keywords>highly irregular shaped objects;semiconductor manufacturing;robotic system;polycrystalline silicon nuggets;fragile fused silica crucible;sampling frequency;packing algorithm;robust 3-D imaging system;irregular shaped objects;commercial manufacturing processes;highly irregular polycrystalline silicon nuggets;active laser triangulation</keywords></doc>

We demonstrate, by means of a simulation experiment, that the resulting system can operate without type-reduction and can achieve similar performance to one that uses type-reduction. Therefore, our new design method, based on the bound sets, can relieve the computation burden of an interval type-2 FLS during its operation, which makes an interval type-2 FLS useful for real-time applications</title><text>We derive inner- and outer-bound sets for the type-reduced set of an interval</text><keywords>uncertainty bounds;interval type-2 fuzzy logic systems;outer-bound sets;type-reduced set;Karnik-Mendel iterative procedure;real-time applications</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>On the use of neural network ensembles in QSAR and QSPR methods have not been widely adopted in structure-activity and structure-property correlation. Neural networks are inherently unstable, in that small changes in the training set and/or training parameters can lead to large changes in their generalization performance. Recent research has shown that by capitalizing on the diversity of the individual models, ensemble techniques can minimize uncertainty and produce more stable and accurate predictors. In this work, we present a critical assessment of the most common ensemble technique known as bootstrap aggregation, or bagging, as applied to QSAR and QSPR. Although aggregation does offer definitive advantages, we demonstrate that bagging may not be the best possible choice and that simpler techniques such as retraining with the full sample can often produce superior results. These findings are rationalized using Krogh and Vedelsby's (1995) decomposition of the generalization error into a term that measures the average generalization performance of the individual networks and a term that measures the diversity among them. For networks that are designed to resist over-fitting, the benefits of aggregation are clear but not overwhelming</title><text>Despite their growing popularity among neural network practitioners, ensemble</text><keywords>neural network ensembles;QSAR;QSPR;training set;training parameters;generalization performance;uncertainty;bootstrap aggregation;bagging;retraining;structure-property correlation</keywords></doc>

This tuning method is based on a genetic algorithm based PID controller design method. For deriving the tuning formula, the genetic algorithm based design method is applied to design PID controllers for a variety of processes. The relationship between the controller parameters and the parameters that characterize the process dynamics are determined and the tuning formula is then derived. Using simulation studies, the rules for assessing the performance of a PID controller tuned by the proposed method are also given. This makes it possible to incorporate the capability to determine if the PID controller is well tuned or not into an autotuner. An autotuner based on this new tuning method and the corresponding performance assessment rules is also established.

In response to this need, this paper proposes a new methodology for the determination of an objective image quality metric, and gives an answer to this problem through three metrics. This methodology is based on the LLAB color space for perception of color in complex images, a modification of the CIELab1976 color space. The first metric proposed is a pixel by pixel metric which introduces a local distance map between two images. The second metric associates, to a pair of images, a global value. Finally, the third metric uses a recursive subdivision of the images to obtain an adaptative distance map, rougher but less expensive to compute than the first method</title><text>Due to the improvement of image rendering processes, and the increasing</text><keywords>quality image metrics;synthetic images;perceptual color differences;image rendering;color images;perceptually based metrics;visual quality;digital simulations;LLAB color space;CIELab1976 color space;pixel by pixel metric;local distance map;global value;recursive subdivision;adaptative distance map</keywords></doc>

The commonly used MSP residual variance is seen to be ineffective, that is it often selects too many sources. Alternatives like the adjusted Hotelling's test, Bayes information criterion and the Wald test on source amplitudes are seen to be effective.

Previous research reported that people tested via the Web or in the lab tended to match the probabilities of their responses to the probabilities that those responses would be reinforced. The optimal strategy, however, is to consistently choose the more frequent event; probability matching produces suboptimal performance. We investigated manipulations we reasoned should improve performance. A horse race scenario in which participants predicted the winner in each of a series of races between two horses was compared with an abstract scenario used previously. Ten groups of learners received different amounts of advice, including all combinations of (1) explicit instructions concerning the optimal strategy, (2) explicit instructions concerning a monetary sum to maximize, and (3) accurate information concerning the probabilities of events. The results showed minimal effects of horse race versus abstract scenario.

<doc><title>Precoded OFDM with adaptive vector channel allocation for scalable video transmission over frequency-selective fading channels wireline and wireless systems for high data rate transmission where severe intersymbol interference (ISI) always occurs. The conventional OFDM system provides advantages through conversion of an ISI channel into ISI-free subchannels at multiple frequency bands. However, it may suffer from channel spectral nulls and heavy data rate overhead due to cyclic prefix insertion. Previously, a new OFDM framework, the precoded OFDM, has been proposed to mitigate the above two problems through precoding and conversion of an ISI channel into ISI-free vector channels. In this paper, we consider the application of the precoded OFDM system to efficient scalable video transmission. We propose to enhance the precoded OFDM system with adaptive vector channel allocation to provide stronger protection against errors to more important layers in the layered bit stream structure of scalable video. The more critical layers, or equivalently, the lower layers, are allocated vector channels of higher transmission quality. The channel quality is characterized by Frobenius norm metrics; based on channel estimation at the receiver. The channel allocation information is fed back periodically to the transmitter through a control channel.

At each resolution level, the image edges are estimated by gradient magnitudes (obtained from the wavelet coefficients), which are modeled probabilistically, and a shrinkage function is assembled based on the model obtained. Joint use of space and scale consistency is applied for better preservation of edges. The shrinkage functions are combined to preserve edges that appear simultaneously at several resolutions, and geometric constraints are applied to preserve edges that are not isolated. The proposed technique produces a filtered version of the original image, where homogeneous regions appear separated by well-defined edges. Possible applications include image presegmentation, and image denoising</title><text>This paper proposes a new method for image denoising with edge preservation,</text><keywords>adaptive image denoising;scale consistency;space consistency;edge preservation;image multiresolution decomposition;redundant wavelet transform;image edges;gradient magnitudes;shrinkage function;geometric constraints</keywords></doc>
<doc><title>An efficient retrieval selection algorithm for video servers with random duplicated assignment storage technique by assigning a number of copies of each data block to different, randomly chosen disks. It has been shown that this approach results in smaller response times and lower disk and RAM costs compared to the well-known disk stripping techniques. Based on this storage approach, one has to determine, for each given batch of data blocks, from which disk each of the data blocks is to be retrieved. This is to be done in such a way that the maximum load of the disks is minimized. The problem is called the retrieval selection problem (RSP). In this paper, we propose a new efficient algorithm for RSP. This algorithm is based on the breadth-first search approach and is able to guarantee optimal solutions for RSP in O(n/sup 2/+mn), where m and n correspond to the number of data blocks and the number of disks, respectively. We show that our proposed algorithm has a lower time complexity than an existing algorithm, called the MFS algorithm</title><text>Random duplicated assignment (RDA) is an approach in which video data is stored</text><keywords>efficient retrieval selection algorithm;video servers;random duplicated assignment storage technique;copies;data block;randomly chosen disks;response times;RAM costs;maximum load;breadth-first search;optimal solutions;time complexity</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>Robust wavelet neuro control for linear brushless motors network learning controller for linear brushless dc motors (LBDCM) are considered. Stability robustness with position tracking is the primary concern. The proposed controller deals mainly with external disturbances, e.g. nonlinear friction force and payload variation in motion control of linear motors. It consists of two parts, one is a state feedback component, and the other one is a learning feedback component. The state feedback controller is designed on the basis of a simple linear model, and the learning feedback component is a wavelet neural controller. The attenuation effect of wavelet neural networks on friction force is first verified by the numerical method. The learning effect of wavelet neural networks on friction force is also shown in the numerical results. Then, a wavelet neural network is applied on a real LBDCM to on-line suppress the friction force, which may be variable due to the different lubrication. The effectiveness of the proposed control schemes is demonstrated by simulated and experimental results</title><text>Design, simulation and experimental implementation of a wavelet basis function</text><keywords>robust wavelet neuro control;linear brushless motors;LBDCM;stability robustness;position tracking;external disturbances;nonlinear friction force;payload variation;motion control;state feedback component;learning feedback component;attenuation effect;friction force;lubrication</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>Designing a screening experiment for highly reliable products reliable products is one of the great challenges. By using a resolution III experiment together with degradation test, Tseng et al. (1995) presented a case study of improving the reliability of fluorescent lamps. However, in conducting such an experiment, they did not address the problem of how to choose the optimal settings of variables, such as sample size, inspection frequency, and termination time for each run, which are influential to the correct identification of significant factors and the experimental cost. Assuming that the product's degradation paths satisfy Wiener processes, this paper proposes a systematic approach to the aforementioned problem. First, an identification rule is proposed. Next, under the constraints of a minimum probability of correct decision and a maximum probability of incorrect decision of the proposed identification rule, the optimum test plan can be obtained by minimizing the total experimental cost. An example is provided to illustrate the proposed method</title><text>Within a reasonable life-testing time, how to improve the reliability of highly</text><keywords>screening experiment;highly reliable products;degradation tests;Wiener process;inspection frequency;termination time;fluorescent lamps;minimum probability of correct decision;maximum probability of incorrect decision;identification rule</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>Causes of the decline of the business school management science course traditional model- and algorithm-based course fails to meet the needs of MBA programs and students. Poor student mathematical preparation is a reality, and is not an acceptable justification for poor teaching outcomes. Management science Ph.D.s are often poorly prepared to teach in a general management program, having more experience and interest in algorithms than management. The management science profession as a whole has focused its attention on algorithms and a narrow subset of management problems for which they are most applicable. In contrast, MBA's rarely encounter problems that are suitable for straightforward application of management science tools, living instead in a world where problems are ill-defined, data is scarce, time is short, politics is dominant, and rational "decision makers" are non-existent. The root cause of the profession's failure to address these issues seems to be (in Russell Ackoff's words) a habit of professional introversion that caused the profession to be uninterested in what MBA's really do on the job and how management science can help them</title><text>The business school management science course is suffering serious decline.

A mixed-norm functional is introduced, which combines the least mean square (LMS) and the least mean fourth (LMF) functionals, as well as a smoothing functional. Two regularization parameters are introduced: one to determine the relative importance of the LMS and LMF functionals, which is a function of the kurtosis, and another to determine the relative importance of the smoothing functional. The two parameters are chosen in such a way that the proposed functional is convex, so that a unique minimizer exists. An iterative algorithm is utilized for obtaining the solution, and its convergence is analyzed. The novelty of the proposed algorithm is that no knowledge of the noise distribution is required, and the relative contributions of the LMS, the LMF, and the smoothing functionals are adjusted based on the partially restored image. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm</title><text>We develop a regularized mixed-norm image restoration algorithm to deal with</text><keywords>iterative regularized least-mean mixed-norm image restoration;noise;mixed-norm functional;smoothing functional;regularization parameters;kurtosis;unique minimizer;iterative algorithm;convergence;noise distribution;partially restored image</keywords></doc>

Technologies like RAID, clustering, and load balancing make this easier, but to actually track uptime, maintain auditable records, and discover patterns in failures to prevent downtime in the future, you'll need to set up external monitoring. Because your Internet connection is a key factor in measuring uptime, you must monitor your site from the Internet itself, beyond your firewall. You could monitor with custom software on remote hosts, or you could use one of the two reasonably priced services available: Mercury Interactive's ActiveWatch and Freshwater Software's SiteSeer.

Few published studies have investigated the differences between Web-based data and data collected with more traditional methods. In order to investigate these potential differences, two important factors were crossed in this study: whether the data were collected on line or not and whether the data were collected in a group setting at a fixed time or individually at a time of the respondent's choosing. The Visions of Morality scale (Shelton and McAdams, 1990) was used, and the participants were assigned to one of four conditions: in-class Web survey, in-class paper-and-pencil survey; take-home Web survey, and take-home paper-and-pencil survey. No significant differences in scores were found for any condition; however, response rates were affected by the type of survey administered, with the take-home Web-based instrument having the lowest response rate.

Frequency estimates for 382 words were obtained and compared across four methods: (1) Internet search engines, (2) the Kucera and Francis (1967) analysis of a traditional linguistic corpus, (3) the CELEX English linguistic database (Baayen et al., 1995), and (4) participant ratings of familiarity. The results showed that Internet search engines produced frequency estimates that were highly consistent with those reported by Kucera and Francis and those calculated from CELEX, highly consistent across search engines, and very reliable over a 6 month period of time. Additional results suggested that Internet search engines are an excellent option when traditional word frequency analyses do not contain the necessary data (e.g., estimates for forenames and slang). In contrast, participants' familiarity judgments did not correspond well with the more objective estimates of word frequency. Researchers are advised to use search engines with large databases (e.g., AltaVista) to ensure the greatest representativeness of the frequency estimates</title><text>The present research investigated Internet search engines as a rapid,</text><keywords>Internet search engines;linguistic corpus;CELEX English linguistic database;large databases</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>A new subspace identification approach based on principal component analysis industrial processes with multiple variables and diagnosing process and sensor faults. The objective of this paper is to develop a new subspace identification algorithm that gives consistent model estimates under the errors-in-variables (EIV) situation. In this paper, we propose a new subspace identification approach using principal component analysis. PCA naturally falls into the category of EIV formulation, which resembles total least squares and allows for errors in both process input and output. We propose to use PCA to determine the system observability subspace, the matrices and the system order for an EIV formulation. Standard PCA is modified with instrumental variables in order to achieve consistent estimates of the system matrices. The proposed subspace identification method is demonstrated using a simulated process and a real industrial process for model identification and order determination.

Tangible and intangible benefits factors, as well as risks factors, must be identified and evaluated. The paper provides a review of ten major evaluation categories and available models, which fall under each category, showing their advantages and disadvantages in handling the above difficulties. This paper describes strategic implications involved in the selection decision, and the inherent difficulties in: (1) choosing or developing a model, (2) obtaining realistic inputs for the model, and (3) making tradeoffs among the conflicting factors. It proposes a conceptual framework to help the decision maker in choosing the most appropriate methodology in the evaluation process. It also offers a new model, called GAHP, for the evaluation problem combining integer goal linear programming and analytic hierarchy process (AHP) in a single hybrid multiple objective multi-criteria model. A goal programming methodology, with zero-one integer variables and mixed integer constraints, is used to set goal target values against which information technology alternatives are evaluated and selected. AHP is used to structure the evaluation process providing pairwise comparison mechanisms to quantify subjective, nonmonetary, intangible benefits and risks factors, in deriving data for the model.

<doc><title>Identification of evolving fuzzy rule-based models proposed. eR models implement a method for the noniterative update of both the rule-base structure and parameters by incremental unsupervised learning. The rule-base evolves by adding more informative rules than those that previously formed the model. In addition, existing rules can be replaced with new rules based on ranking using the informative potential of the data. In this way, the rule-base structure is inherited and updated when new informative data become available, rather than being completely retrained. The adaptive nature of these evolving rule-based models, in combination with the highly transparent and compact form of fuzzy rules, makes them a promising candidate for modeling and control of complex processes, competitive to neural networks. The approach has been tested on a benchmark problem and on an air-conditioning component modeling application using data from an installation serving a real building. The results illustrate the viability and efficiency of the approach</title><text>An approach to identification of evolving fuzzy rule-based (eR) models is</text><keywords>evolving fuzzy rule-based models;identification;noniterative update;rule-base structure;incremental unsupervised learning;ranking;informative potential;fuzzy rules;complex processes;air-conditioning component modeling</keywords></doc>

Positive and negative aspects of gift acceptance are discussed. Gifts bring value for academic libraries. Gifts can be considered additional routes to contribute to library collections without direct purchases, options to add money to the library budget, and the cement of social relationships. But, unfortunately, large donations are time-consuming, labor-intensive and costly to process. Great amounts of staff time and processing space are two main negative aspects that cause concern and put the value of gift acceptance under consideration by librarians.

The proposed algorithm is especially effective for the unwrapping of speckle-coded interferogram contour maps. In contrast to earlier unwrapping algorithms by region, we propose a local discontinuity-restoring criterion to serve as the preprocessor or postprocessor of our hybrid algorithm, which makes the unwrapping by region much easier and more efficient. With this hybrid algorithm, a robust, stable, and especially time effective phase unwrapping can be achieved. Additionally, the criterion and limitation of this hybrid algorithm are fully described. The robustness, stability, and speed of this hybrid algorithm are also studied. The proposed algorithm can be easily upgraded with minor modifications to solve the unwrapping problem of maps with phase inconsistency.

The degradation in signal-to-noise ratio is not observed for the variation of the supply voltage down to 1.5 V, which means the proposed scheme is suitable for low-voltage applications</title><text>A high-conversion-rate high-resolution oversampling digital-to-analog converter</text><keywords>digital-to-analog converter;CMOS technology;direct digital modulation;differential-quad switching;signal-to-noise ratio</keywords></doc>
<doc><title>Adaptive state feedback control for a class of linear systems with unknown bounds of uncertainties systems with disturbance and nonlinear uncertainties is considered. The bounds of the disturbance and uncertainties are assumed to be unknown, being even arbitrary. For such uncertain dynamical systems, the adaptive robust state feedback controller is obtained. And the resulting closed-loop systems are asymptotically stable in theory. Moreover, an adaptive robust state feedback control scheme is given. The scheme ensures the closed-loop systems exponentially practically stable and can be used in practical engineering. Finally, simulations show that the control scheme is effective</title><text>The problem of adaptive robust stabilization for a class of linear time-varying</text><keywords>robust stabilization;nonlinear uncertainties;closed-loop systems;uncertain dynamical systems;state feedback</keywords></doc>
<doc><title>Geometrically invariant watermarking using feature points robustness to geometrical distortions. The weaknesses of classical watermarking methods to geometrical distortions are outlined first. Geometrical distortions can be decomposed into two classes: global transformations such as rotations and translations and local transformations such as the StirMark attack. An overview of existing self-synchronizing schemes is then presented. Theses schemes can use periodical properties of the mark, invariant properties of transforms, template insertion, or information provided by the original image to counter geometrical distortions. Thereafter, a new class of watermarking schemes using the image content is presented. We propose an embedding and detection scheme where the mark is bound with a content descriptor defined by salient points. Three different types of feature points are studied and their robustness to geometrical transformations is evaluated to develop an enhanced detector. The embedding of the signature is done by extracting feature points of the image and performing a Delaunay tessellation on the set of points. The mark is embedded using a classical additive scheme inside each triangle of the tessellation. The detection is done using correlation properties on the different triangles. The performance of the presented scheme is evaluated after JPEG compression, geometrical attack and transformations. Results show that the fact that the scheme is robust to these different manipulations. Finally, in our concluding remarks, we analyze the different perspectives of such content-based watermarking scheme</title><text>This paper presents a new approach for watermarking of digital images providing</text><keywords>geometrically invariant watermarking;feature points;digital images;geometrical distortions;global transformations;rotations;translations;local transformations;StirMark attack;self-synchronizing schemes;periodical properties;invariant properties;transforms;template insertion;image content;embedding;detection scheme;content descriptor;Delaunay tessellation;additive scheme;correlation properties;JPEG compression;geometrical attack</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>In search of a general enterprise model in models to support decision making. Such reluctance could be overcome if a model could be used for several purposes rather than using a traditional "single perspective" model. This requires the development of a "general enterprise model" (GEM), which can be applied to a wide range of problem domains with unlimited scope. Current enterprise modelling frameworks only deal effectively with nondynamic modelling issues whilst dynamic modelling issues have traditionally only been addressed at the operational level. Although the majority of research in this area relates to manufacturing companies, the framework for a GEM must be equally applicable to service and public sector organisations. The paper identifies five key design issues that need to be considered when constructing a GEM.

Using a problem-based learning approach that is highly interactive, Alien Rescue engages students in scientific investigations aimed at finding solutions to complex and meaningful problems. Problem-based learning (PBL) is an instructional strategy proven to be effective in medical and business fields, and it is increasingly popular in education. However, using PBL in K-12 classrooms is challenging and requires access to rich knowledge bases and cognitive tools. Alien Rescue is designed to provide such cognitive support for successful use of PBL in sixth-grade classrooms. The design and development of Alien Rescue is guided by current educational research. Research is an integral part of this project. Results of formative evaluation and research studies are being integrated into the development and improvement of the program. Alien Rescue is designed in accordance with the National Science Standards and the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS) for science.

The article provides general observations on Bearman's archival imagination, lists some of its components, and addresses elements of Henry's critique.

Based on an earlier made convolution model of Egghe, interpreted and reworked now for discrete scores, we are able to produce theoretical fractional frequency distributions with only one parameter, which are in very close agreement with the practical ones as found in a large dataset produced earlier by Rao (1995).

I: Methodology and experiments with synthesized data approach to the implementation of a number of the leading algorithms, and report the results of three experiments using synthesized data. Experiments using synthesized data are important because the ground truth is known, possible confounds due to camera characterization and pre-processing are absent, and various factors affecting color constancy can be efficiently investigated because they can be manipulated individually and precisely. The algorithms chosen for close study include two gray world methods, a limiting case of a version of the Retinex method, a number of variants of Forsyth's (1990) gamut-mapping method, Cardei et al.'s (2000) neural net method, and Finlayson et al.'s color by correlation method (Finlayson et al. 1997, 2001; Hubel and Finlayson 2000) . We investigate the ability of these algorithms to make estimates of three different color constancy quantities: the chromaticity of the scene illuminant, the overall magnitude of that illuminant, and a corrected, illumination invariant, image. We consider algorithm performance as a function of the number of surfaces in scenes generated from reflectance spectra, the relative effect on the algorithms of added specularities, and the effect of subsequent clipping of the data. All data is available on-line at http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~color/data, and implementations for most of the algorithms are also available (http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~color/code)</title><text>We introduce a context for testing computational color constancy, specify our</text><keywords>computational color constancy algorithms;synthesized data;gray world methods;Retinex method;gamut-mapping method;neural net method;color by correlation method;chromaticity;scene illuminant;algorithm performance;reflectance spectra;specularities;clipping</keywords></doc>

For example, suppose data is stored in a CD-jukebox. Then, when a disc is loaded for access, users that need data on the disc can concurrently access the disc, while users that need data on a different disc have to wait until the current disc is unloaded. The design issues for group mutual exclusion have been modeled as the Congenial Talking Philosophers problem, and solutions for shared memory models have been proposed (Y.-J. Young, 2000; P. Keane and M. Moir, 1999). As in ordinary mutual exclusion and many other problems in distributed systems, however, techniques developed for shared memory do not necessarily apply to message passing (and vice versa). We investigate solutions for Congenial Talking Philosophers in computer networks where processes communicate by asynchronous message passing. We first present a solution that is a straightforward adaptation from G. Ricart and A.K. Agrawala's (1981) algorithm for ordinary mutual exclusion. Then we show that the simple modification suffers a severe performance degradation that could cause the system to behave as though only one process of a group can be in the critical section at a time. We then present a more efficient and highly concurrent distributed algorithm for the problem, the first such solution in computer networks</title><text>Group mutual exclusion occurs naturally in situations where a resource can be</text><keywords>congenial talking philosophers problem;computer networks;group mutual exclusion;distributed systems;asynchronous message passing;critical section;concurrent distributed algorithm</keywords></doc>

We argue that these algorithms are computationally deficient in that they fail to generate, or learn, appropriate perceptual representations under certain circumstances. An alternative neural network architecture is presented here in which nodes compete for the right to receive inputs rather than for the right to generate outputs. This form of competition, implemented through preintegration lateral inhibition, does provide appropriate coding properties and can be used to learn such representations efficiently. Furthermore, this architecture is consistent with both neuroanatomical and neuropsychological data.

Our algorithm has O(k) remote step complexity and O(log k) system response time, where k is the point contention. The remote step complexity is the maximal number of steps performed by a process where a wait is counted as one step. The system response time is the time interval between subsequent entries to the critical section, where one time unit is the minimal interval in which every active process performs at least one step.

As memory chips are much slower than arithmetic processors, codes that involve a high data movement compared to the number of arithmetic operations are executed comparatively slower. Hence, matrix-matrix multiplications are much faster than matrix-vector multiplications. It is seen that it is not sufficient to compare only the complexity, but also the actual performance of algorithms to judge on faster execution. Implications involve FDTD loops, LU factorizations, and iterative solvers for dense matrices.

The article examines the need for labor archivists to reach out actively to unions and the problems they face in getting their message across, not only to union leadership but also to union members. Outreach by labor archivists is vital on three critical fronts: the need to secure union funding in support of labor archival programs; obtaining union cooperation in reviewing and amending obsolete deposit agreements; and coordinating efforts with unions to save the records of closing district and local union offices. Attempting to resolve these outstanding issues, labor archivists are pulled between two distinct institutional cultures (one academic in nature, the other enmeshed in a union bureaucracy) and often have their own labor archival programs compromised by the internal dynamics and politics inherent in administering large academic libraries and unions. If labor archivists are to be successful, they must find their collective voice within the labor movement and establish their relevancy to unions during a period of momentous change and restructuring. Moreover, archivists need to give greater thought to designing and implementing outreach programs that bridge the fundamental "disconnect" between union bureaucracies and the rank and file, and unions and the public</title><text>As the American labor movement continues on its path toward reorganization and</text><keywords>American labor movement;archivists;cultural changes;labor unions;labor archivists;union leadership;union members;union funding;labor archival programs;union cooperation;obsolete deposit agreements;union offices;institutional cultures;union bureaucracy;internal dynamics;large academic libraries;collective voice</keywords></doc>

Enzymatic acetic acid esters hydrolysis 2001, 12, 75-92) was applied to a series of 25 acetylcholinesterase hydrolysis substrates. Statistically significant MTD-PLS models (q/sup 2/ between 0.7 and 0.8) are in agreement with previous MTD models, with the advantage that local contributions are understood beyond the occupancy/nonoccupancy interpretation in MTD. A "chemically intuitive" approach further forces MTD-PLS coefficients to assume only negative (or zero) values for fragmental volume descriptors and positive (or zero) values for fragmental hydrophobicity descriptors. This further separates the various kinds of local interactions at each vertex of the MTD hypermolecule, making this method suitable for medicinal chemistry synthesis planning</title><text>The PLS variant of the MTD method (T.I.

The article draws a historical linkage between the relative stability of an organization's task environment starting after the Second World War to the present environmental instability that now characterizes many industries. Specifically, the authors suggest that advances in IT have enabled managers to adapt existing forms and create new models for organizational design that better fit requirements of an unstable environment. Time has seemingly borne out this hypothesis as the bureaucratic structure evolved to the matrix to the network and now to the emerging shadow structure. IT has gone from a support mechanism to a substitute for organizational structures in the form of the shadow structure.

<doc><title>Genetic algorithm guided selection: variable selection and subset selection method utilizes a simple encoding scheme which can represent both compounds and variables used to construct a QSAR/QSPR model. A genetic algorithm is then utilized to simultaneously optimize the encoded variables that include both descriptors and compound subsets. The GAS method generates multiple models each applying to a subset of the compounds. Typically the subsets represent clusters with different chemotypes. Also a procedure based on molecular similarity is presented to determine which model should be applied to a given test set compound. The variable selection method implemented in GAS has been tested and compared using the Selwood data set (n = 31 compounds; nu = 53 descriptors). The results showed that the method is comparable to other published methods. The subset selection method implemented in GAS has been first tested using an artificial data set (n = 100 points; nu = 1 descriptor) to examine its ability to subset data points and second applied to analyze the XLOGP data set (n = 1831 compounds; nu = 126 descriptors). The method is able to correctly identify artificial data points belonging to various subsets. The analysis of the XLOGP data set shows that the subset selection method can be useful in improving a QSAR/QSPR model when the variable selection method fails</title><text>A novel genetic algorithm guided selection method, GAS, has been described.

To obtain exact estimates and a detailed analysis of the problem, the notion is introduced of a generalized confidence set for a statistically indeterminate random vector. Properties of generalized confidence sets are studied. It is shown that the standard method of estimation, which relies on the unification of confidence sets, leads in many cases to wider confidence estimates. For a normally distributed random vector with an inaccurately known mean value, generalized confidence sets are built tip and the dependence of sizes of a generalized confidence set on the forms and parameters of a set of possible mean values is examined</title><text>A problem is considered for the construction of confidence sets for a random</text><keywords>generalized confidence sets;statistically indeterminate random vector;distribution parameters;normally distributed random vector</keywords></doc>

The bit rate is fixed to 2.0 bits/pixel, whose performance is moderate in terms of compression ratio compared to other compression schemes such as discrete cosine transform (DCT), vector quantization (VQ), wavelet transform coding (WTC), etc. Two kinds of overheads are required for BTC coding: bit plane and quantization values, respectively. A new technique is presented to reduce the bit plane overhead. Conventional bit plane overhead is 1.0 bits/pixel; we decrease it to 0.734 bits/pixel while maintaining the same decoded quality as absolute moment BTC (AMBTC) does for the "Lena" image. Compared to other published bit plane coding strategies, the proposed method outperforms all of the existing methods</title><text>Block truncation coding (BTC) is a successful image compression technique due</text><keywords>image bit plane coding;block truncation coding;image compression technique;bit rate;performance;compression ratio;bit plane overhead;decoded quality;absolute moment BTC;AMBTC;quantization values;Lena image</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>Separation and tracking of multiple broadband sources with one electromagnetic vector sensor sources with an electromagnetic vector sensor (EMVS) is presented. The structure consists of a set of parallel spatial processors, one for each individual source. Two stages of processing are involved in each spatial processor. The first preprocessing stage rejects all other sources except the one of interest, while the second stage is an adaptive one for maximizing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and tracking the desired source. The preprocessings are designed using the latest source parameter estimates obtained from the source trackers, and a redesign is activated periodically or whenever any source has been detected by the source trackers to have made significant movement. Compared with conventional adaptive beamforming, the algorithm has the advantage that no a priori information on any desired signal location is needed, the sources are separated at maximum SNR, and their locations are available. The structure is also well suited for parallel implementation.

One consists in applying regression methods to convert from the K camera outputs to a device-independent color space such as CIEXYZ or CIELAB.

The problems observed in the November 2000 US election accelerated existing trends to get rid of lever machines, punch-cards, and hand-counted paper ballots and replace them with mark-sense balloting, Internet, and automatic teller machine (ATM) kiosk style computer-based systems. An estimated US $2-$4 billion will be spent in the United States and Canada to update voting systems during the next decade. Voting online might enable citizens to vote even if they are unable to get to the polls. Yet making these methods work right turns out to be considerably more difficult than originally thought. New electronic voting systems pose risks as well as solutions. As it turns out, many of the voting products currently for sale provide less accountability, poorer reliability, and greater opportunity for widespread fraud than those already in use.

Based on the two paradigms, structure from motion and linear intensity subspaces, we introduce the geotensity constraint that governs the relationship between four or more images of a moving object. We show that it is possible in theory to solve for 3D Lambertian surface structure for the case of a single point light source and propose that a solution exists for an arbitrary number point light sources.

The discussion combines historical analysis with strategic analysis to provide a framework to analyse a key component of the computer industry. This analysis begins from the perspective of government research and development spending; then examines the confusion around the evolution of the high-end computing market in the context of standard theories of technology strategy and new product innovation. Rather than the high-end market being 'dead', one should view the market as changing due to increased capability and competition from the low-end personal computer market. The high-end market is also responding to new product innovation from the introduction of new parallel computing architectures.

Our work utilizes maxima of wavelet coefficients to form the basic features of a correlation-based automatic registration algorithm. Our wavelet-based registration algorithm is tested successfully with data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM), which differ by translation and/or rotation. By the choice of high-frequency wavelet features, this method is similar to an edge-based correlation method, but by exploiting the multiresolution nature of a wavelet decomposition, our method achieves higher computational speeds for comparable accuracies.

Medical images used to be an essential part of surgical education and documentation as well as diagnosis and operation planning over many years. With the recent introduction of navigation techniques in orthopaedic surgery, a new field of application has been opened. Today surgical navigation systems - also known as image-guided surgery systems - are available for various applications in orthopaedic surgery. They visualize the position and orientation of surgical instruments as graphical overlays onto a medical image of the operated anatomy on a computer monitor. Preoperative image data such as computed tomography scans or intra operatively generated images (for example, ultrasonic, endoscopic or fluoroscopic images) are suitable for this purpose. A new category of medical images termed 'surgeon-defined anatomy' has been developed that exclusively relies upon the usage of navigation technology. Points on the anatomy are digitized interactively by the surgeon and are used to build up an abstract geometrical model of the bony structures to be operated on. This technique may be used when no other image data is available or appropriate for a given application</title><text>This paper presents a review of surgical navigation systems in orthopaedics and</text><keywords>orthopaedic surgical navigation;medical image modalities;surgical education;image-guided surgery systems;surgical instruments;graphical overlays;computer monitor;computed tomography scans;intra operatively generated images;abstract geometrical model;bony structures</keywords></doc>

Those with an eye on history are quick to point to Wurman's 1976 use of the term "architecture of information," but it has only been in the last 2 years that IA has become the source of sufficient interest for people to label themselves professionally as Information Architects. The impetus for this recent emergence of IA can be traced to a historical summit, supported by ASIS&T in May 2000 at Boston. It was here that several hundred of us gathered to thrash out the questions of just what IA was and what this new field might become. At the time of the summit, invited to present a short talk on my return journey from the annual ACM SIGCHI conference, I entered the summit expecting little and convinced that IA was nothing new. I left 2 days later refreshed, not just by the enthusiasm of the attendees for this term but by IA's potential to unify the disparate perspectives and orientations of professionals from a range of disciplines. It was at this summit that the idea for the special issue took root. I proposed the idea to Don Kraft, hoping he would find someone else to run with it. AS luck would have it, I ended up taking charge of it myself, with initial support from David Blair.

<doc><title>Accurate modeling of lossy nonuniform transmission lines by using differential quadrature methods differential quadrature method (DQM), which has been adapted to model lossy uniform and nonuniform transmission lines. The DQM can quickly compute the derivative of a function at any point within its bounded domain by estimating a weighted linear sum of values of the function at a small set of points belonging to the domain. Using the DQM, the frequency-domain Telegrapher's partial differential equations for transmission lines can be discretized into a set of easily solvable algebraic equations. DQM reduces interconnects into multiport models whose port voltages and currents are related by rational formulas in the frequency domain. Although the rationalization process in DQM is comparable with the Pade approximation of asymptotic waveform evaluation (AWE) applied to transmission lines, the derivation mechanisms in these two disparate methods are significantly different. Unlike AWE, which employs a complex moment-matching process to obtain rational approximation, the DQM requires no approximation of transcendental functions, thereby avoiding the process of moment generation and moment matching. Due to global sampling of points in the DQM approximation, it requires far fewer grid points in order to build accurate discrete models than other numerical methods do. The DQM-based time-domain model can be readily integrated in a circuit simulator like SPICE</title><text>This paper discusses an efficient numerical approximation technique, called the</text><keywords>lossy nonuniform transmission lines;differential quadrature method;numerical approximation technique;partial differential equations;algebraic equations;interconnects;multiport models;rationalization process;time-domain model</keywords></doc>

This is done starting from the basic equations for nonisothermal, non-Newtonian flows in a three-dimensional domain. We derive systems for both (T/sup 0/, p/sup 0/) and (T/sup 1/, p/sup 1/) in the presence of body forces and sources. We find that body forces and sources have a nonlinear effect on the systems. We also derive a nonlinear "Darcy law". Our formulation includes not only the pressure gradient, but also body forces and sources, which play the role of a nonlinearity.

<doc><title>Model predictive control helps to regulate slow processes-robust barrel temperature control even more challenging when multiple zones are involved, such as in barrel temperature control for extruders. Often, strict closed-loop performance requirements (such as fast startup with no overshoot and maintaining tight temperature control during production) are given for such applications. When characteristics of the system are examined, it becomes clear that a commonly used proportional plus integral plus derivative (PID) controller cannot meet such performance specifications for this kind of system. The system either will overshoot or not maintain the temperature within the specified range during the production run. In order to achieve the required performance, a control strategy that utilizes techniques such as model predictive control, autotuning, and multiple parameter PID is formulated. This control strategy proves to be very effective in achieving the desired specifications, and is very robust</title><text>Slow temperature control is a challenging control problem.

<doc><title>Plenoptic image editing designed to maintain consistency between multiple images of a physical 3D scene. The distinguishing feature of these operations is that edits to any one image propagate automatically to all other images as if the (unknown) 3D scene had itself been modified. The modified scene can then be viewed interactively from any other camera viewpoint and under different scene illuminations. The approach is useful first as a power-assist that enables a user to quickly modify many images by editing just a few, and second as a means for constructing and editing image-based scene representations by manipulating a set of photographs. The approach works by extending operations like image painting, scissoring, and morphing so that they alter a scene's plenoptic function in a physically-consistent way, thereby affecting scene appearance from all viewpoints simultaneously. A key element in realizing these operations is a new volumetric decomposition technique for reconstructing an scene's plenoptic function from an incomplete set of camera viewpoints</title><text>This paper presents a new class of interactive image editing operations</text><keywords>interactive image editing operations;multiple images;physical 3D scene;modified scene;camera viewpoint;image-based scene representations;image painting;scissoring;morphing;plenoptic function;volumetric decomposition technique;plenoptic image editing</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>Scale-invariant segmentation of dynamic contrast-enhanced perfusion MR images with inherent scale selection signal-driven approaches for pixel-based image segmentation. Often, different possibly conflicting criteria need to be fulfilled in order to obtain the best trade-off between uncertainty (variance) and location accuracy. The optimal set of scales depends on several factors: the noise level present in the image material, the prior distribution of the different types of segments, the class-conditional distributions associated with each type of segment as well as the actual size of the (connected) segments. We analyse, theoretically and through experiments, the possibility of using the overall and class-conditional error rates as criteria for selecting the optimal sampling of the linear and morphological scale spaces. It is shown that the overall error rate is optimized by taking the prior class distribution in the image material into account. However, a uniform (ignorant) prior distribution ensures constant class-conditional error rates. Consequently, we advocate for a uniform prior class distribution when an uncommitted, scale-invariant segmentation approach is desired. Experiments with a neural net classifier developed for segmentation of dynamic magnetic resonance (MR) images, acquired with a paramagnetic tracer, support the theoretical results. Furthermore, the experiments show that the addition of spatial features to the classifier, extracted from the linear or morphological scale spaces, improves the segmentation result compared to a signal-driven approach based solely on the dynamic MR signal. The segmentation results obtained from the two types of features are compared using two novel quality measures that characterize spatial properties of labelled images</title><text>Selection of the best set of scales is problematic when developing</text><keywords>scale-invariant segmentation;dynamic contrast-enhanced perfusion MR images;inherent scale selection;pixel-based image segmentation;noise level;class-conditional error rates;optimal sampling;experiments;neural net classifier;paramagnetic tracer;quality measures;labelled images;class-conditional distributions</keywords></doc>
<doc><title>On the emergence of rules in neural networks grammars) from sequences of arbitrary input symbols by inventing abstract representations that accommodate unseen symbol sets as well as unseen but similar grammars. The neural network is shown to have the ability to transfer grammatical knowledge to both new symbol vocabularies and new grammars. Analysis of the state-space shows that the network learns generalized abstract structures of the input and is not simply memorizing the input strings. These representations are context sensitive, hierarchical, and based on the state variable of the finite-state machines that the neural network has learned. Generalization to new symbol sets or grammars arises from the spatial nature of the internal representations used by the network, allowing new symbol sets to be encoded close to symbol sets that have already been learned in the hidden unit space of the network. The results are counter to the arguments that learning algorithms based on weight adaptation after each exemplar presentation (such as the long term potentiation found in the mammalian nervous system) cannot in principle extract symbolic knowledge from positive examples as prescribed by prevailing human linguistic theory and evolutionary psychology</title><text>A simple associationist neural network learns to factor abstract rules (i.e.,</text><keywords>associationist neural network;learns;abstract rules;neural network;state-space;symbolic knowledge</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>A self-adjusting quality of service control scheme with the goal of optimizing the system reward as a result of servicing different priority clients with varying workload, QoS and reward/penalty requirements. Our scheme is based on resource partitioning and designated "degrade QoS areas" such that system resources are partitioned into priority areas each of which is reserved specifically to serve only clients in a corresponding class with no QoS degradation, plus one "degraded QoS area" into which all clients can be admitted with QoS adjustment being applied only to the lowest priority clients. We show that the best partition is dictated by the workload and the reward/penalty characteristics of clients in difference priority classes. The analysis results can be used by a QoS manager to optimize the system total reward dynamically in response to changing workloads at run time.

<doc><title>Estimation of error in curvature computation on multi-scale free-form surfaces surface is presented. This is achieved by convolving local parametrisations of the surface with 2-D Gaussian filters iteratively. In our technique, semigeodesic coordinates are constructed at each vertex of the mesh. Smoothing results are shown for 3-D surfaces with different shapes indicating that surface noise is eliminated and surface details are removed gradually. A number of evolution properties of 3-D surfaces are described. Next, the surface Gaussian and mean curvature values are estimated accurately at multiple scales which are then mapped to colours and displayed directly on the surface. The performance of the technique when selecting different directions as an arbitrary direction for the geodesic at each vertex are also presented. The results indicate that the error observed for the estimation of Gaussian and mean curvatures is quite low after only one iteration. Furthermore, as the surface is smoothed iteratively, the error is further reduced. The results also show that the estimation error of Gaussian curvature is less than that of mean curvature. Our experiments demonstrate that estimation of smoothed surface curvatures are very accurate and not affected by the arbitrary direction of the first geodesic line when constructing semigeodesic coordinates. Our technique is independent of the underlying triangulation and is also more efficient than volumetric diffusion techniques since 2-D rather than 3-D convolutions are employed. Finally, the method presented here is a generalisation of the Curvature Scale Space method for 2-D contours. The CSS method has outperformed comparable techniques within the MPEG-7 evaluation framework. As a result, it has been selected for inclusion in the MPEG-7 package of standards</title><text>A novel technique for multi-scale curvature computation on a free-form 3-D</text><keywords>multi-scale curvature computation;local parametrisations;surface noise;evolution properties;mean curvature values;semigeodesic coordinates;underlying triangulation;volumetric diffusion techniques;convolutions;Curvature Scale Space method;MPEG-7 evaluation framework</keywords></doc>

Building on Ravi Sandhu's four-layer OM-AM (objectives, models, architectures, and mechanisms) idea, we aim to use information spaces to construct a model for privacy control that supports our socially based privacy objectives.

<doc><title>From a biological to a computational model for the autonomous behavior of an animat difficult for several reasons. First, behavior is such a wide topic that a general framework paradigm of inspiration must be chosen in order to obtain a consistent model. Such a framework can be, for example, biological modeling or an artificial intelligence approach. Second, a general framework is not sufficient to determine a fully specified program to be implemented in a robot. Many choices, tuning and tests must be carried out before obtaining a robust system. A biological model is presented, based on the definition of cortex-like automata, representing elementary functions in the perceptive, motor or associative domain. These automata are connected in a network whose architecture, functioning and learning rules are described in a cortical framework. Second, the computational model derived from that biological model is specified. The way units exchange and compute variables through links is explained, with reference to corresponding biological elements. It is then easier to report experiments allowing an autonomous system to learn regularities of a simple environment and to exploit them to satisfy some internal drives. Even if additional biological hints can be added, this model allow us to better understand how a biological model can be implemented and how biological properties can emerge from a distributed set of units</title><text>Endowing an autonomous system like a robot with intelligent behavior is</text><keywords>autonomous system;robot;autonomous behavior;intelligent behavior;animat;tuning;tests;robust system;biological model;cortex-like automata;elementary functions;associative domain;learning rules;architecture;computational model;links;simple environment;internal drives</keywords></doc>

Although numerous methods have been developed for the design of the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller, little work has been done in relation to the quantitative time-domain and frequency-domain responses. In this paper, we study the following problem: Given a nominal stable process with time delay, we design a suboptimal PID controller to achieve the required time-domain response or frequency-domain response for the nominal system or the uncertain system. An H/sub infinity / PID controller is developed based on optimal control theory and the parameters are derived analytically.

<doc><title>Relevance of Web documents: ghosts consensus method systems is often called "digital democracy." Such an approach implies the utilization of the majority opinion of Internet users to determine the most relevant documents: for example, citation index usage for sorting of search results (google.com) or an enrichment of a query with terms that are asked frequently in relation with the query's theme. "Digital democracy" is an effective instrument in many cases, but it has an unavoidable shortcoming, which is a matter of principle: the average intellectual and cultural level of Internet users is very low; everyone knows what kind of information is dominant in Internet query statistics. Therefore, when one searches the Internet by means of "digital democracy" systems, one gets answers that reflect an underlying assumption that the user's mind potential is very low, and that his cultural interests are not demanding. Thus, it is more correct to use the term "digital ochlocracy" to refer to Internet search systems with "digital democracy." Based on the well-known mathematical mechanism of linear programming, we propose a method to solve the indicated problem</title><text>The dominant method currently used to improve the quality of Internet search</text><keywords>Internet search systems;digital democracy;majority opinion;citation index usage;search results;Internet query statistics;digital ochlocracy;linear programming;ghosts consensus method</keywords></doc>
<doc><title>Matching PET and CT scans of the head and neck area: Development of method and validation biology, but lacks detailed anatomical information. Our aim in the present study was to develop and validate an automatic registration method for matching PET and CT scans of the head and neck. Three difficulties in achieving this goal are (1) nonrigid motions of the neck can hamper the use of automatic ridged body transformations; (2) emission scans contain too little anatomical information to apply standard image fusion methods; and (3) no objective way exists to quantify the quality of the match results. These problems are solved as follows: accurate and reproducible positioning of the patient was achieved by using a radiotherapy treatment mask. The proposed method makes use of the transmission rather than the emission scan. To obtain sufficient (anatomical) information for matching, two bed positions for the transmission scan were included in the protocol. A mutual information-based algorithm was used as a registration technique. PET and CT data were obtained in seven patients. Each patient had two CT scans and one PET scan. The datasets were used to estimate the consistency by matching PET to CT/sub 1/, CT/sub 1/ to CT/sub 2/, and CT/sub 2/ to PET using the full circle consistency test. It was found that using our method, consistency could be obtained of 4 mm and 1.3 degrees on average. The PET voxels used for registration were 5.15 mm, so the errors compared quite favorably with the voxel size. Cropping the images (removing the scanner bed from images) did not improve the consistency of the algorithm. The transmission scan, however, could potentially be reduced to a single position using this approach. In conclusion, the represented algorithm and validation technique has several features that are attractive from both theoretical and practical point of view, it is a user-independent, automatic validation technique for matching CT and PET scans of the head and neck, which gives the opportunity to compare different image enhancements</title><text>Positron emission tomography (PET) provides important information on tumor</text><keywords>anatomical information;automatic registration method;head;neck;nonrigid motions;automatic ridged body transformations;standard image fusion methods;radiotherapy treatment mask;bed positions;transmission scan;mutual information-based algorithm;registration technique;patients;full circle consistency test;errors;scanner bed;image enhancements</keywords></doc>

Meanwhile, to translate hypertext markup language (HTML) pages into proper WML ones becomes imperative since it is difficult for WAP users to read most contents designed for PC users via their mobile phone screens. However, for those sites that have been maintained with hypertext markup language (HTML), considerable time and manpower costs will be incurred to rebuild them with WML. In this paper, we propose an intelligent WAP site management system to cope with these problems. With the help of the intelligent management system, the original contents of HTML Web sites can be automatically translated to proper WAP content in an efficient way. As a consequence, the costs associated with maintaining WAP sites could be significantly reduced. The management system also allows the system manager to define the relevance of numerals and keywords for removing unimportant or meaningless contents. The original contents will be reduced and reorganized to fit the size of mobile phone screens, thus reducing the communication cost and enhancing readability.

MP employs arrays of property descriptors with little correlation to divide large compound pools into partitions from which representative molecules can be selected. In each of n subsequent steps, a population of molecules is divided into subpopulations above and below the median value of a property descriptor until a desired number of 2/sup n/ partitions are obtained.

These servicing strategies represent a renewable free-replacement, nonrenewable free-replacement, renewable pro-rata, and a nonrenewable minimal-repair warranty plans. The results are extended to determine the mean and variance of total discounted warranty costs for the total sales over the life cycle of the product.

<doc><title>A pretopological approach for structural analysis encountered in structural analysis. This approach is based upon the pretopological concepts of pseudoclosure and minimal closed subsets. The advantage of this approach is that it provides a framework which is general enough to model and formulate different types of connections that exist between the elements of a population. In addition, it has enabled us to develop a new structural analysis algorithm. An explanation of the definitions and properties of the pretopological concepts applied in this work is first shown and illustrated in sample settings. The structural analysis algorithm is then described and the results obtained in an economic study of the impact of geographic proximity on scientific collaborations are presented</title><text>The aim of this paper is to present a methodological approach for problems</text><keywords>pretopological approach;structural analysis;minimal closed subsets;pseudoclosure;connections;economic study;geographic proximity;scientific collaborations</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>Improving computer security for authentication of users: influence of proactive password restrictions identification and authentication in computer systems. However, it is a notoriously weak method, in that the passwords adopted by many users are easy to crack. In an attempt to, improve security, proactive password checking may be used, in which passwords must meet several criteria to be more resistant to cracking. In two experiments, we examined the influence of proactive password restrictions on the time that it took to generate an acceptable password and to use it subsequently to log in. The required length was a minimum of five characters in experiment I and eight characters in experiment 2. In both experiments, one condition had only the length restriction, and the other had additional restrictions. The additional restrictions greatly increased the time it took to generate the password but had only a small effect on the time it took to use it subsequently to log in. For the five-character passwords, 75% were cracked when no other restrictions were imposed, and this was reduced to 33% with the additional restrictions. For the eight-character passwords, 17% were cracked with no other restrictions, and 12.5% with restrictions. The results indicate that increasing the minimum character length reduces crackability and increases security, regardless of whether additional restrictions are imposed</title><text>Entering a user name-password combination is a widely used procedure for</text><keywords>computer security;proactive password checking;proactive password restrictions;length restriction;five-character passwords;eight-character passwords</keywords></doc>

Using contextual cues, users can infer during a conversation what the other person is doing and what is happening in his or her immediate surroundings. For example, if a user learns that the other person is talking with somebody else or is involved in some urgent activity, he or she knows to expect a slower response. Conversely, if the user learns that the other person is sitting in a meeting directly related to the conversation, he or she then knows to respond more quickly. Also, by informing users about the other person's context and tagging potentially ambiguous chat messages, ConChat explores how context can improve electronic communication by reducing semantic conflicts</title><text>ConChat is a context-aware chat program that enriches electronic communication</text><keywords>context-aware chat program;ConChat;contextual information;semantic conflicts;contextual cues</keywords></doc>

Microscope-based systems provide excellent spatial resolution which allows the response of individual cells to be measured. However, such systems have a restricted depth of focus and, as leaves are inherently uneven, only a small proportion of each image at any given focal plane is in focus. In this report we describe the development of algorithms, specifically adapted for imaging chlorophyll fluorescence and photosynthetic function in living plant cells, which allow extended-focus images to be reconstructed from images taken in different focal planes. We describe how these procedures can be used to reconstruct images of chlorophyll fluorescence and calculated photosynthetic parameters, as well as producing a map of leaf topology. The robustness of this procedure is demonstrated using leaves from a number of different plant species</title><text>Imaging dynamic changes in chlorophyll a fluorescence provides a valuable means</text><keywords>chlorophyll fluorescence;intact leaves;extended depth-of-focus imaging;plant species;calculated photosynthetic parameters;microscope-based systems;spatial resolution</keywords></doc>

In order to find the general solution of a density functionally gradient piezoelectric cantilever, we have used the inverse method (i.e. the Airy stress function method). We have obtained the stress and induction functions in the form of polynomials as well as the general solution of the beam. Based on this general solution, we have deduced the solutions of the cantilever under different loading conditions. Furthermore, as applications of this general solution in engineering, we have studied the tip deflection and blocking force of a piezoelectric cantilever actuator.

<doc><title>Diffraction limit for a circular mask with a periodic rectangular apertures array a leading role in modern technology for uses such as pinhole cameras, coded imaging systems, optical information processing, etc. because of its high resolution, its infinite depth of focus, and its usefulness over a broad frequency spectra ranging from visible light to X-rays and gamma rays. While the masks with periodic apertures investigated in the literature are limited only to far-field diffraction, they do not take the shift of apertures within the mask into consideration. Therefore the derivation of the far-field diffraction for a single aperture cannot be applied to a mask with periodic apertures. The far-field diffraction formula modified for a multiaperture mask has been proposed in the past, the analysis remains too complicated to offer some practical guidance for mask design. We study a circular mask with periodic rectangular apertures and develop an easier way to interpret it. First, the near-field diffraction intensity of a circular aperture is calculated by means of Lommel's function. Then the convolution of the circular mask diffraction with periodic rectangular apertures is put together, and we can present a simple mathematical tool to analyze the mask properties including the intensity distribution, blurring aberration, and the criterion of defining the far- or near-field diffraction. This concept can also be expanded to analyze different types of masks with the arbitrarily shaped apertures</title><text>A mask with periodic apertures imaging system is adopted very widely and plays</text><keywords>diffraction limit;circular mask;periodic rectangular apertures array;pinhole cameras;coded imaging systems;optical information processing;high resolution;infinite depth of focus;broad frequency spectra;visible light;gamma rays;periodic apertures;far-field diffraction;mask;single aperture;far-field diffraction formula;multiaperture mask;periodic rectangular apertures;convolution;circular mask diffraction;near-field diffraction;arbitrarily shaped apertures</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>A comparison of computational color constancy Algorithms. II. Experiments with image data leading computational color constancy algorithms using a comprehensive set of images. These were of 33 different scenes under 11 different sources representative of common illumination conditions. The algorithms studied include two gray world methods, a version of the Retinex method, several variants of Forsyth's (1990) gamut-mapping method, Cardei et al.'s (2000) neural net method, and Finlayson et al.'s color by correlation method (Finlayson et al. 1997, 2001; Hubel and Finlayson 2000). We discuss a number of issues in applying color constancy ideas to image data, and study in depth the effect of different preprocessing strategies. We compare the performance of the algorithms on image data with their performance on synthesized data. All data used for this study are available online at http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~color/data, and implementations for most of the algorithms are also available (http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~color/code). Experiments with synthesized data (part one of this paper) suggested that the methods which emphasize the use of the input data statistics, specifically color by correlation and the neural net algorithm, are potentially the most effective at estimating the chromaticity of the scene illuminant. Unfortunately, we were unable to realize comparable performance on real images. Here exploiting pixel intensity proved to be more beneficial than exploiting the details of image chromaticity statistics, and the three-dimensional (3-D) gamut-mapping algorithms gave the best performance</title><text>For pt.I see ibid., vol. 11, no.9, p.972-84 (2002).

We propose an adaptive control methodology for a class of nonlinear systems with a time-varying structure. This class of systems is composed of interpolations of nonlinear subsystems which are input-output feedback linearizable. Both indirect and direct adaptive control methods are developed, where the spatially localized models (in the form of Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy systems or radial basis function neural networks) are used as online approximators to learn the unknown dynamics of the system. Without assumptions on rate of change of system dynamics, the proposed adaptive control methods guarantee that all internal signals of the system are bounded and the tracking error is asymptotically stable. The performance of the adaptive controller is demonstrated using a jet engine control problem</title><text>Adaptive control for nonlinear time-varying systems is of both theoretical and</text><keywords>adaptive neural/fuzzy control;interpolated nonlinear systems;time-varying systems;spatially localized models;Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy systems;radial basis function neural networks;online approximators;unknown dynamics;tracking error;jet engine control</keywords></doc>

The time series studied are the exchange rates between the US Dollar and 18 other foreign currencies from within and without the Euro zone. Our goal was to determine if their dynamical behaviours were in some way correlated. The nonexistence of stationarity called for the application of recurrence quantification analysis as a tool for this analysis, and is based on the definition of several parameters that allow for the quantification of recurrence plots. The method was checked using the European Monetary System currency exchanges. The results show, as expected, the high correlation between the currencies that are part of the Euro, but also a strong correlation between the Japanese Yen, the Canadian Dollar and the British Pound.

The tracking algorithm changes the duty ratio of the converter such that the solar cell array (SCA) voltage equals the voltage corresponding to the MP point at that solar insolation. This is done by the feedforward loop, which generates an error signal by comparing the instantaneous array voltage and reference voltage. The reference voltage for the feedforward loop, corresponding to the MP point, is obtained by an off-line trained neural network. Experimental data is used for off-line training of the neural network, which employs back-propagation algorithm. The proposed fuzzy feedforward peak power tracking effectiveness is demonstrated through the simulation and experimental results, and compared with the conventional proportional plus integral (PI) controller based system.

The theoretical formula of the eccentric light beam approach deduced can be applied not only to an object lens whose objective plane is just at the focal plane, but also to an object lens whose objective plane is not at the focal plane. The experimental setup uses a semiconductor laser device as the light source. The laser beam that enters into the microscope is eccentric with the main light axis. A defocused signal is acquired by a symmetrical silicon photocell for the change of the reflected light position caused by differential amplification and processed by a microprocessor. Then the electric signal is power-amplified and drives a dc motor, which moves a fine working platform to an automatic focus of the microscope. The result of the experiments shows a +or-0.1- mu m precision of autofocusing for a range of +or-500- mu m defocusing.

Using the concept of topographical distance, the watershed segmentation can be formulated as a minimization. This new viewpoint gives a way to combine the results of the watershed algorithm on different surfaces. In particular, our algorithm determines the contour as a combination of the current edge map and the contour, predicted from the tracking result in the previous frame. We also show that the problem of background clutter can be relaxed by taking the object motion into account. The compensation with object motion allows to detect and remove spurious edges in background. The experimental results confirm the expected advantages of the proposed method over the existing approaches</title><text>We propose a new method for contour tracking in video.

<doc><title>Streaming, disruptive interference and power-law behavior in the exit dynamics of confined pedestrians room. Pedestrians are modeled as cellular automata and compete to escape via a known exit at the soonest possible time. A pedestrian could move forward, backward, left or right within each iteration time depending on adjacent cell vacancy and in accordance with simple rules that determine the compulsion to move and physical capability relative to his neighbors. The arching signatures of jamming were observed and the pedestrians exited in bursts of various sizes. Power-law behavior is found in the burst-size frequency distribution for exit widths w greater than one cell dimension (w > 1). The slope of the power-law curve varies with w from -1.3092 (w = 2) to -1.0720 (w = 20). Streaming which is a diffusive behavior, arises in large burst sizes and is more likely in a single-exit room with w = 1 and leads to a counterintuitive result wherein an average exit throughput Q is obtained that is higher than with w = 2, 3, or 4. For a two-exit room (w = 1), Q is not greater than twice the yield of a single-exit room. If the doors are not separated far enough (< 4w), Q becomes even significantly less due to a collective slow-down that emerges among pedestrians crossing in each other's path (disruptive interference effect). For the same w and door number, Q is also higher with relaxed pedestrians than with anxious ones</title><text>We analyze the exit dynamics of pedestrians who are initially confined in a</text><keywords>streaming;cellular automata;iteration time;adjacent cell vacancy;arching signatures;jamming;burst-size frequency distribution;collective slow-down;disruptive interference;power-law behavior;exit dynamics;confined pedestrians</keywords></doc>
<doc><title>The development of a mobile manipulator imaging system for bridge crack inspection crack inspection. During bridge safety inspections, an eyesight inspection is made for preliminary evaluation and screening before a more precise inspection. The inspection for cracks is an important part of the preliminary evaluation. Currently, the inspectors must stand on the platform of a bridge inspection vehicle or a temporarily erected scaffolding to examine the underside of a bridge. However, such a procedure is risky. To help automate the bridge crack inspection process, we installed two CCD cameras and a four-axis manipulator system on a mobile vehicle. The parallel cameras are used to detect cracks. The manipulator system is equipped with binocular charge coupled devices (CCD) for examining structures that may not be accessible to the eye. The system also reduces the danger of accidents to the human inspectors. The manipulator system consists of four arms. Balance weights are placed at the ends of arms 2 and 4, respectively, to maintain the center of gravity during operation. Mechanically, arms 2 and 4 can revolve smoothly. Experiments indicated that the system could be useful for bridge crack inspections</title><text>A mobile manipulator imaging system is developed for the automation of bridge</text><keywords>mobile manipulator;imaging system;bridge crack inspection;automation;eyesight inspection;CCD cameras;four-axis manipulator;parallel cameras;charge coupled devices</keywords></doc>

Even though some have known asymptotic properties, it is important to test their accuracy by using simulated series of different lengths. We test R/S analysis, detrended fluctuation analysis and periodogram regression methods on samples drawn from Gaussian white noise. The DFA statistics turns out to be the unanimous winner. Unfortunately, no asymptotic distribution theory has been derived for this statistics so far. We were able, however, to construct empirical (i.e. approximate) confidence intervals for all three methods.

These details are crucial concerning the method's performance as it is shown in a comparative analysis and helps to improve the accuracy of the built-up model. Finally, we propose a possible further rule base reduction which can be applied successfully in certain cases.

This formulation has two advantages. First, the time-step size is no longer governed by the spatial discretization of the mesh, but rather by the Nyquist sampling criterion. Second, the implementation of the truncation by the perfectly matched layers (PML) is straightforward. An anisotropic PML absorbing material is presented for the truncation of FETD lattices. Reflection less than -50 dB is obtained numerically over the entire propagation bandwidth in waveguide and microstrip line. A benchmark test on a microwave amplifier indicates that this extended FETD algorithm is not only superior to finite-difference time-domain-based algorithm in mesh flexibility and simulation accuracy, but also reduces computation time dramatically</title><text>This paper proposes an extension of the unconditionally stable finite-element</text><keywords>global electromagnetic analysis;active nonlinear microwave circuits;Nyquist sampling criterion;time-step size;perfectly matched layers;anisotropic PML absorbing material;waveguide;microstrip line;microwave amplifier;mesh flexibility;simulation accuracy</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>When a better interface and easy navigation aren't enough: examining the information architecture in a law enforcement agency system and quickly recover from mistakes is often defined as a highly usable system. But usability in systems design goes beyond a good interface and efficient navigation. In this article we describe two database systems in a law enforcement agency. One system is a legacy, text-based system with cumbersome navigation (RMS); the newer system is a graphical user interface with simplified navigation (CopNet). It is hypothesized that law enforcement users will evaluate CopNet higher than RMS, but experts of the older system will evaluate it higher than others will. We conducted two user studies. One study examined what users thought of RMS and CopNet, and compared RMS experts' evaluations with nonexperts. We found that all users evaluated CopNet as more effective, easier to use, and easier to navigate than RMS, and this was especially noticeable for users who were not experts with the older system. The second, follow-up study examined use behavior after CopNet was deployed some time later. The findings revealed that evaluations of CopNet were not associated with its use. If the newer system had a better interface and was easier to navigate than the older, legacy system, why were law enforcement personnel reluctant to switch? We discuss reasons why switching to a new system is difficult, especially for those who are most adept at using the older system. Implications for system design and usability are also discussed</title><text>An information architecture that allows users to easily navigate through a</text><keywords>information architecture;law enforcement agency;RMS;graphical user interface;simplified navigation;CopNet;law enforcement users</keywords></doc>

Students were given self-explanation-reading training (SERT), which teaches strategies that facilitate self-explanation during reading, such as elaboration based on world knowledge and bridging between text sentences. During a computerized version of SERT practice, students read texts and typed self-explanations into a computer after each sentence. The use of SERT strategies during this practice was assessed by determining the extent to which students used the information in the current sentence versus the prior text or world knowledge in their self-explanations. This assessment was made on the basis of human judgments and LSA. Both human judgments and LSA were remarkably similar and indicated that students who were not complying with SERT tended to paraphrase the text sentences, whereas students who were compliant with SERT tended to explain the sentences in terms of what they knew about the world and of information provided in the prior text context. The similarity between human judgments and LSA indicates that LSA will be useful in accounting for reading strategies in a Web-based version of SERT</title><text>We tested a computer-based procedure for assessing reader strategies that was</text><keywords>latent semantic analysis;computer-based procedure;verbal protocols;self-explanation-reading training;elaboration;world knowledge;human judgments</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>Guidelines, the Internet, and personal health: insights from the Canadian HEALNet experience in a Canadian Network of Centres of Excellence, devoted to the promotion of evidence-based practice, and to relate this experience to Internet support of health promotion and consumer health informatics. A subjective review of insights is undertaken. Work directed the development of systems incorporating guidelines, care maps, etc., for use by professionals met with limited acceptance. Evidence-based tools for health care consumers are a desirable complement but require radically different content and delivery modes. In addition to evidence-based material offered by professionals, a wide array of Internet-based products and services provided by consumers for consumers emerged and proved a beneficial complement. The consumer-driven products and services provided via the Internet are a potentially important and beneficial complement of traditional health services. They affect the health consumer-provider roles and require changes in healthcare practices</title><text>The objectives are to summarize the insights gained in collaborative research</text><keywords>collaborative research;Canadian Network of Centres of Excellence;evidence-based practice;Internet support;health promotion;consumer health informatics;personal health;health consumer-provider roles</keywords></doc>

An alternative criterion is derived based on maximizing entropy and used for speeding up the searching algorithm. Five forms of conditional probability distributions-simple, linear, parabola concave, parabola convex, and S-function-are employed and compared to each other for optimal threshold determination. The effect of precision on optimal threshold determination is discussed and a trade-off precision epsilon =0.001 is selected experimentally.

<doc><title>Prospects for quantitative computed tomography imaging in the presence of foreign metal bodies using statistical image reconstruction applicators or other metal foreign objects exhibit severe artifacts including streaks and aliasing. We have systematically evaluated via computer simulations the impact of scattered radiation, the polyenergetic spectrum, and measurement noise on the performance of three reconstruction algorithms: conventional filtered backprojection (FBP), deterministic iterative deblurring, and a new iterative algorithm, alternating minimization (AM), based on a CT detector model that includes noise, scatter, and polyenergetic spectra. Contrary to the dominant view of the literature, FBP streaking artifacts are due mostly to mismatches between FBP's simplified model of CT detector response and the physical process of signal acquisition. Artifacts on AM images are significantly mitigated as this algorithm substantially reduces detector-model mismatches. However, metal artifacts are reduced to acceptable levels only when prior knowledge of the metal object in the patient, including its pose, shape, and attenuation map, are used to constrain AM's iterations. AM image reconstruction, in combination with object-constrained CT to estimate the pose of metal objects in the patient, is a promising approach for effectively mitigating metal artifacts and making quantitative estimation of tissue attenuation coefficients a clinical possibility</title><text>X-ray computed tomography (CT) images of patients bearing metal intracavitary</text><keywords>quantitative computed tomography imaging;foreign metal bodies;statistical image reconstruction;object-constrained CT;iterative algorithm;alternating minimization;CT detector model;noise;scatter;polyenergetic spectra;clinical possibility;deterministic iterative deblurring;filtered backprojection</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>Theoretical and experimental investigations on coherence of traffic noise transmission through an open window into a rectangular room in high-rise buildings inside a rectangular room in a high-rise building and that outside the open window of the room is proposed. The traffic noise transmitted into a room is generally dominated by low-frequency components, to which active noise control (ANC) technology may find an application. However, good coherence between reference and error signals is essential for an effective noise reduction and should be checked first. Based on traffic noise prediction methods, wave theory, and mode coupling theory, the results of this paper enabled one to determine the potentials and limitations of ANC used to reduce such a transmission. Experimental coherence results are shown for two similar, empty rectangular rooms located on the 17th and 30th floors of a 34 floor high-rise building. The calculated results with the proposed method are generally in good agreement with the experimental results and demonstrate the usefulness of the method for predicting the coherence</title><text>A method for theoretically calculating the coherence between sound pressure</text><keywords>traffic noise transmission;open window;rectangular room;high-rise buildings;sound pressure;low-frequency components;traffic noise prediction methods;mode coupling theory;wave theory</keywords></doc>

Kelvin-Helmholtz instability This is a survey of the literature on hybrid simulation of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. We start with a brief review of the theory: the simplest model of the instability - a transition layer in the form of a tangential discontinuity; compressibility of the medium; finite size of the velocity shear region; pressure anisotropy. We then describe the electromagnetic hybrid model (ions as particles and electrons as a massless fluid) and the main numerical schemes. We review the studies on two-dimensional and three-dimensional hybrid simulation of the process of particle mixing across the magnetopause shear layer driven by the onset of a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. The article concludes with a survey of literature on hybrid simulation of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in finite-size objects: jets moving across the magnetic field in the middle of the field reversal layer; interaction between a magnetized plasma flow and a cylindrical plasma source with zero own magnetic field</title><text>For pt.III. see Prikl.

<doc><title>A spatial rainfall simulator for crop production modeling in Southern Africa set of spatial units in areas where long-term meteorological records are available for a small number of sites only. The work forms part of a larger simulation model of the food system in a district of Zimbabwe, which includes a crop production component for yields of maize, small grains and groundnuts. Only a limited number of meteorological stations are available within or surrounding the district that have long time series of rainfall records. Preliminary analysis of rainfall data for these stations suggested that intra-seasonal temporal correlation was negligible, but that rainfall at any given station was correlated with rainfall at neighbouring stations. This spatial correlation structure can be modeled using a multivariate normal distribution consisting of 30 related variables, representing dekadly rainfall in each of the 30 wards. For each ward, log-transformed rainfall for each of the 36 dekads in the year was characterized by a mean and standard deviation, which were interpolated from surrounding meteorological stations. A covariance matrix derived from a distance measure was then used to represent the spatial correlation between wards. Sets of random numbers were then drawn from this distribution to simulate rainfall across the wards in any given dekad. Cross-validation of estimated rainfall parameters against observed parameters for the one meteorological station within the district suggests that the interpolation process works well. The methodology developed is useful in situations where long-term climatic records are scarce and where rainfall shows pronounced spatial correlation, but negligible temporal correlation</title><text>This paper describes a methodology for simulating rainfall in dekads across a</text><keywords>simulating rainfall;crop production modeling;Zimbabwe;covariance matrix;rainfall records;rainfall data;spatial correlation;multivariate normal distribution;Southern Africa</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>Automated breath detection on long-duration signals using feedforward backpropagation artificial neural networks analysis of respiratory data acquired during sleep. The algorithm is based on two independent artificial neural networks (ANN/sub insp/ and ANN/sub expi/) that recognize, in the original signal, windows of interest where the onset of inspiration and expiration occurs. Postprocessing consists in finding inside each of these windows of interest minimum and maximum corresponding to each inspiration and expiration. The ANN/sub insp/ and ANN/sub expi/ correctly determine respectively 98.0% and 98.7% of the desired windows, when compared with 29 820 inspirations and 29 819 expirations detected by a human expert, obtained from three entire-night recordings. Postprocessing allowed determination of inspiration and expiration onsets with a mean difference with respect to the same human expert of (mean +or- SD) 34 +or- 71 ms for inspiration and 5 +or- 46 ms for expiration. The method proved to be effective in detecting the onset of inspiration and expiration in full night continuous recordings. A comparison of five human experts performing the same classification task yielded that the automated algorithm was undifferentiable from these human experts, failing within the distribution of human expert results. Besides being applicable to adult respiratory volume data, the presented algorithm was also successfully applied to infant sleep data, consisting of uncalibrated rib cage and abdominal movement recordings. A comparison with two previously published algorithms for breath detection in respiratory volume signal shows that the presented algorithm has a higher specificity, while presenting similar or higher positive predictive values</title><text>A new breath-detection algorithm is presented, intended to automate the</text><keywords>automated breath detection;postprocessing;inspiration;expiration;automated algorithm;human experts;entire-night recordings;uncalibrated rib cage;abdominal movement recordings;infant sleep data;adult respiratory volume data;long-duration signals;feedforward backpropagation artificial neural networks</keywords></doc>
<doc><title>Presentation media, information complexity, and learning outcomes combinations. Educators have observed that visuals enhance learning which suggests that multimedia presentations should be superior to text-only and text with static pictures in facilitating optimal human information processing and, therefore, comprehension. The article reports the findings from a 3 (text-only, overhead slides, and multimedia presentation)*2 (high and low information complexity) factorial experiment. Subjects read a text script, viewed an acetate overhead slide presentation, or viewed a multimedia presentation depicting the greenhouse effect (low complexity) or photocopier operation (high complexity). Multimedia was superior to text-only and overhead slides for comprehension. Information complexity diminished comprehension and perceived presentation quality. Multimedia was able to reduce the negative impact of information complexity on comprehension and increase the extent of sustained attention to the presentation. These findings suggest that multimedia presentations invoke the use of both the verbal and visual working memory channels resulting in a reduction of the cognitive load imposed by increased information complexity. Moreover, multimedia superiority in facilitating comprehension goes beyond its ability to increase sustained attention; the quality and effectiveness of information processing attained (i.e., use of verbal and visual working memory) is also significant</title><text>Multimedia computing provides a variety of information presentation modality</text><keywords>presentation media;information complexity;learning outcomes;visual working memory channel;multimedia computing;educators;multimedia presentations;static pictures;optimal human information processing;overhead slides;text script;acetate overhead slide presentation;multimedia presentation;greenhouse effect;photocopier operation;cognitive load;multimedia superiority;sustained attention</keywords></doc>

Eight factors identified contributed to student discomfort: computer skills, paradigm shifts, trust, time management, thinking about their own thinking, systematic inquiry, self-assessment, and scientific discourse. These factors suggested developing understanding through inquiry by conducting a self-designed, open-ended, systematic inquiry required autonomous learning involving metacognitive skills and time management skills.

<doc><title>A formal model of computing with words are generalizations of classical automata where the knowledge about the system's next state is vague or uncertain. It is worth noting that like classical automata, fuzzy automata can only process strings of input symbols. Therefore, such fuzzy automata are still (abstract) devices for computing with values, although a certain vagueness or uncertainty are involved in the process of computation. We introduce a new kind of fuzzy automata whose inputs are instead strings of fuzzy subsets of the input alphabet. These new fuzzy automata may serve as formal models of computing with words. We establish an extension principle from computing with values to computing with words. This principle indicates that computing with words can be implemented with computing with values with the price of a big amount of extra computations</title><text>Classical automata are formal models of computing with values.

<doc><title>Adaptive filtering for noise reduction in hue saturation intensity color space in color image processing and analysis, the conversion formulas from the RGB color model to HSI are nonlinear and complicated in comparison with the conversion formulas of other color models. When an RGB image is degraded by random Gaussian noise, this nonlinearity leads to a nonuniform noise distribution in HSI, making accurate image analysis more difficult. We have analyzed the noise characteristics of the HSI color model and developed an adaptive spatial filtering method to reduce the magnitude of noise and the nonuniformity of noise variance in the HSI color space. With this adaptive filtering method, the filter kernel for each pixel is dynamically adjusted, depending on the values of intensity and saturation. In our experiments we have filtered the saturation and hue components and generated edge maps from color gradients. We have found that by using the adaptive filtering method, the minimum error rate in edge detection improves by approximately 15%</title><text>Even though the hue saturation intensity (HSI) color model has been widely used</text><keywords>adaptive filtering;noise reduction;hue saturation intensity color space;color image processing;RGB color model;random Gaussian noise;nonuniform noise distribution;accurate image analysis;adaptive spatial filtering method;nonuniformity;noise variance;HSI color space;filter kernel;pixel;saturation;intensity;generated edge maps;color gradients;edge detection;minimum error rate</keywords></doc>
<doc><title>Restoration of broadband imagery steered with a liquid-crystal optical phased array beam-steering components (i.e., mirrors and gimbals) with a nonmechanical device. One such device is a nematic liquid crystal optical phased array (LCOPA). An LCOPA can implement a blazed phase grating to steer the incident light. However, when a phase grating is used in a broadband imaging system, two adverse effects can occur. First, dispersion will cause different incident wavelengths arriving at the same angle to be steered to different output angles, causing chromatic aberrations in the image plane. Second, the device will steer energy not only to the first diffraction order, but to others as well. This multiple-order effect results in multiple copies of the scene appearing in the image plane. We describe a digital image restoration technique designed to overcome these degradations. The proposed postprocessing technique is based on a Wiener deconvolution filter. The technique, however, is applicable only to scenes containing objects with approximately constant reflectivities over the spectral region of interest. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique</title><text>In many imaging applications, it is highly desirable to replace mechanical</text><keywords>broadband imagery;imaging applications;mirrors;gimbals;nonmechanical device;nematic liquid crystal optical phased array;blazed phase grating;broadband imaging system;dispersion;incident wavelengths;output angles;chromatic aberrations;image plane;optical phased array;first diffraction order;multiple-order effect;multiple copies;digital image restoration technique;postprocessing technique;Wiener deconvolution filter;approximately constant reflectivities;spectral region of interest</keywords></doc>
<doc><title>Collective action in the age of the Internet: mass communication and online mobilization practices on the Web bear witness to thriving collective action ranging from persuasive to confrontational, individual to collective, undertakings. Even more influential than direct calls for action is the indirect mobilizing influence of the Internet's powers of mass communication, which is boosted by an antiauthoritarian ideology on the Web. Theoretically, collective action through the otherwise socially isolating computer is possible because people rely on internalized group memberships and social identities to achieve social involvement. Empirical evidence from an online survey among environmental activists and nonactivists confirms that online action is considered an equivalent alternative to offline action by activists and nonactivists alike. However, the Internet may slightly alter the motives underlying collective action and thereby alter the nature of collective action and social movements. Perhaps more fundamental is the reverse influence that successful collective action will have on the nature and function of the Internet</title><text>This article examines how the Internet transforms collective action.

Two concepts, originally developed to solve the problems of convergence of other network types, are proposed to be applied to Kohonen networks: a functional relationship between the number of neurons and the number of learning examples and a criterion to break off learning. The latter one can be shown to be conform with the process of self-organization by using U-matrices for visualization of the learning procedure. The predictions made using these neural models are compared for accuracy with observations and with the prognoses prepared using six models: two hydrodynamic models, a statistical model, a nearest neighbor model, the persistence model, and the verbal forecasts that are broadcast and kept on record by the Sea Level Forecast Service of the Federal Maritime and Hydrography Agency (BSH) in Hamburg. Before training the maps, the meteorological and oceanographic situation has to be condensed as well as possible, and the weight and learning vectors have to be made as small as possible.

This vital direction-giving document is, however, not always easy to develop and the authors thereof battle with questions such as what constitutes a policy. This results in the policy authors turning to existing sources for guidance. One of these sources is the various international information security standards. These standards are a good starting point for determining what the information security policy should consist of, but should not be relied upon exclusively for guidance. Firstly, they are not comprehensive in their coverage and furthermore, tending to rather address the processes needed for successfully implementing the information security policy.

Then, choosing the radii and positions of cooling lines as design variables, the boundary integral sensitivity formulations are deduced. For the optimum design of cooling lines, the squared difference between the objective temperature and temperature of the cavity is taken as the objective function. Based on the optimization techniques with design sensitivity analysis, an iterative algorithm to reach the minimum value of the objective function is introduced, which leads to the optimum design of cooling lines at the same time</title><text>A three-dimensional numerical simulation using the boundary element method is</text><keywords>injection moulding;boundary element method;cavity temperature distributions;cooling stage;iterative algorithm;objective function;optimization</keywords></doc>

Three routeing policies - no alternative routings, alternative routeing dynamics and alternative routeing plans - are considered with four dispatching rules with finite buffer capacity.

The performance measures considered are makespan, average machine utilization, average flow time and average delay at local input buffers. Simulation results indicate that the alternative routings dynamic policy gives the best results in three performance measures except for average delay at local input buffers.

<doc><title>Self-calibration from image derivatives from image motion fields induced by a rigidly moving camera with unknown parameters, where the image formation is modeled with a linear pinhole-camera model. The equations obtained show the flow to be separated into a component due to the translation and the calibration parameters and a component due to the rotation and the calibration parameters. A set of parameters encoding the latter component is linearly related to the flow, and from these parameters the calibration can be determined. However, as for discrete motion, in general it is not possible to decouple image measurements obtained from only two frames into translational and rotational components. Geometrically, the ambiguity takes the form of a part of the rotational component being parallel to the translational component, and thus the scene can be reconstructed only up to a projective transformation. In general, for full calibration at least four successive image frames are necessary, with the 3D rotation changing between the measurements. The geometric analysis gives rise to a direct self-calibration method that avoids computation of optical flow or point correspondences and uses only normal flow measurements. New constraints on the smoothness of the surfaces in view are formulated to relate structure and motion directly to image derivatives, and on the basis of these constraints the transformation of the viewing geometry between consecutive images is estimated. The calibration parameters are then estimated from the rotational components of several flow fields. As the proposed technique neither requires a special set up nor needs exact correspondence it is potentially useful for the calibration of active vision systems which have to acquire knowledge about their intrinsic parameters while they perform other tasks, or as a tool for analyzing image sequences in large video databases</title><text>This study investigates the problem of estimating camera calibration parameters</text><keywords>camera calibration parameters;image motion fields;rigidly moving camera;image formation;linear pinhole-camera model;calibration parameters;image measurements;translational components;rotational components;direct self-calibration method;optical flow;point correspondences;normal flow measurements;active vision systems;image sequences;large video databases</keywords></doc>

The authors examine a case of deception in an online community composed primarily of information technology professionals. In this case, an established community member (DF) invented a character (Nowheremom) whom he fell in love with and who was eventually killed in a tragic accident. When other members of the community eventually began to question Nowheremom's actual identity, DF admitted that he invented her. The discussion board was flooded with reactions to DF's revelation. The authors propose several explanations for the perpetration of identity deception, including psychiatric illness, identity play, and expressions of true self. They also analyze the reactions of community members and propose three related explanations (social identity, deviance, and norm violation) to account for their reactions.

<doc><title>Online auctions: dynamic pricing and the lodging industry rapidly being displaced by Web site scripting, online intermediaries, and specialty brokers. Businesses that pioneered Internet usage relied on it as a sales and marketing alternative to predecessor product distribution channels. As such, Web sites replace the traditional trading model to the Internet. Web-enabled companies are popular because the medium renders the process faster, less costly, highly reliable, and secure. Auction-based models impact business models by converting the price setting mechanism from supplier-centric to market-centric and transforming the trading model from "one to many" to "many to many." Historically, pricing was based on the cost of production plus a margin of profit. Traditionally, as products and services move through the supply chain, from the producer to the consumer, various intermediaries added their share of profit to the price. As Internet based mediums of distribution become more prevalent, traditional pricing models are being supplanted with dynamic pricing. A dynamic pricing model represents a flexible system that changes prices not only from product to product, but also from customer to customer and transaction to transaction. Many industry leaders are skeptical of the long run impact of online auctions on lodging industry profit margins, despite the fact pricing theory suggests that an increase in the flow of information results in efficient market pricing. The future of such endeavors remains promising, but controversial</title><text>The traditional channels of distribution for overnight accommodation are</text><keywords>online auctions;dynamic pricing;lodging industry;Web site scripting;online intermediaries;specialty brokers;Internet usage;sales;marketing;trading model;business models;price setting mechanism;supply chain</keywords></doc>

One of the major obstacles in low-voltage DRAM is the degradation of data-retention time due to low signal level at the memory cell, which requires power-consuming refresh operations more frequently. This paper proposes an offset-cancellation sense-amplifier scheme (OCSA) that improves data-retention time significantly even at low supply voltage. It also improves die efficiency, because the proposed scheme reduces the number of sense amplifiers by supporting more cells in each sense amplifier. Measurements show that the data-retention time of the proposed scheme at 1.5-V supply voltage is 2.4 times of the conventional scheme at 2.0 V</title><text>A novel bitline sensing scheme is proposed for low-voltage DRAM to achieve low</text><keywords>bitline sensing scheme;data-retention time;memory cell;power-consuming refresh operations</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>Effective moving cast shadow detection for monocular color traffic image sequences robust segmentation of moving vehicles from the stationary background is generally required. However, the presence of moving cast shadow may lead to an inaccurate vehicle segmentation, and as a result, may lead to further erroneous scene analysis. We propose an effective method for the detection of moving cast shadow. By observing the characteristics of cast shadow in the luminance, chrominance, gradient density, and geometry domains, a combined probability map, called a shadow confidence score (SCS), is obtained. From the edge map of the input image, each edge pixel is examined to determine whether it belongs to the vehicle region based on its neighboring SCSs. The cast shadow is identified as those regions with high SCSs, which are outside the convex hull of the selected vehicle edge pixels. The proposed method is tested on 100 vehicle images taken under different lighting conditions (sunny and cloudy), viewing angles (roadside and overhead), vehicle sizes (small, medium, and large), and colors (similar to the road and not). The results indicate that an average error rate of around 14% is obtained while the lowest error rate is around 3% for large vehicles</title><text>For an accurate scene analysis using monocular color traffic image sequences, a</text><keywords>effective moving cast shadow detection;monocular color traffic image sequences;accurate scene analysis;robust segmentation;moving vehicles;stationary background;moving cast shadow;inaccurate vehicle segmentation;erroneous scene analysis;luminance;chrominance;gradient density;geometry domains;combined probability map;shadow confidence score;input image;cast shadow;convex hull;selected vehicle edge pixels;lighting conditions;vehicle images;sunny;cloudy;viewing angles;vehicle sizes;average error rate</keywords></doc>
<doc><title>Real-time implementation of a new low-memory SPIHT image coding algorithm using DSP chip and Pearlman's (1996) set partitioning in hierarchical trees (SPIHT) algorithm is well-known for its simplicity and efficiency. This paper deals with the real-time implementation of SPIHT algorithm using DSP chip. In order to facilitate the implementation and improve the codec's performance, some relative issues are thoroughly discussed, such as the optimization of program structure to speed up the wavelet decomposition. SPIHT's high memory requirement is a major drawback for hardware implementation. In this paper, we modify the original SPIHT algorithm by presenting two new concepts-number of error bits and absolute zerotree. Consequently, the memory cost is significantly reduced. We also introduce a new method to control the coding process by number of error bits.

The vector evaluations obtained in this way are in general weakly efficient. To identify the efficient evaluations, the second step maximizes the sum of the criteria on the set generated in step 1. We prove the relationship between the evaluations and decisions obtained by the proposed procedure, on the one hand, and the efficient (weakly efficient) evaluations and decisions, on the other hand.

However, in the application of POT in quantitative structure-activity relationship modeling, only the compounds directly comparable to the noninvestigated compounds are applied. To explore the possibilities of improving the methodology, the theory is extended by application of the so-called linear extensions of the model order.

<doc><title>Lossy to lossless object-based coding of 3-D MRI data exploiting the diagnostic relevance of the different regions of the volumetric data for rate allocation. The data are first decorrelated via a 3-D discrete wavelet transform. The implementation via the lifting steps scheme allows to map integer-to-integer values, enabling lossless coding, and facilitates the definition of the object-based inverse transform. The coding process assigns disjoint segments of the bitstream to the different objects, which can be independently accessed and reconstructed at any up-to-lossless quality. Two fully 3-D coding strategies are considered: embedded zerotree coding (EZW-3D) and multidimensional layered zero coding (MLZC), both generalized for region of interest (ROI)-based processing. In order to avoid artifacts along region boundaries, some extra coefficients must be encoded for each object. This gives rise to an overheading of the bitstream with respect to the case where the volume is encoded as a whole. The amount of such extra information depends on both the filter length and the decomposition depth. The system is characterized on a set of head magnetic resonance images.

<doc><title>Fuzzy polynomial neural networks: hybrid architectures of fuzzy modeling modeling architecture combining polynomial neural networks (PNNs) and fuzzy neural networks (FNNs). The development of the FPNNs dwells on the technologies of computational intelligence (CI), namely fuzzy sets, neural networks, and genetic algorithms. The structure of the FPNN results from a synergistic usage of FNN and PNN. FNNs contribute to the formation of the premise part of the rule-based structure of the FPNN. The consequence part of the FPNN is designed using PNNs. The structure of the PNN is not fixed in advance as it usually takes place in the case of conventional neural networks, but becomes organized dynamically to meet the required approximation error. We exploit a group method of data handling (GMDH) to produce this dynamic topology of the network. The performance of the FPNN is quantified through experimentation that exploits standard data already used in fuzzy modeling. The obtained experimental results reveal that the proposed networks exhibit high accuracy and generalization capabilities in comparison to other similar fuzzy models</title><text>We introduce a concept of fuzzy polynomial neural networks (FPNNs), a hybrid</text><keywords>fuzzy polynomial neural networks;hybrid architectures;fuzzy modeling;computational intelligence;fuzzy sets;genetic algorithms;group method of data handling;GMDH;dynamic topology</keywords></doc>

Thus, we propose that the returns are modeled by the first Poincare return time of a low-dimensional chaotic trajectory. This modeling, which captures the recurrent properties of the return fluctuations, is able to predict well the evolution of the observed statistical quantities. In addition, it explains the reason for which stocks present simultaneously dynamical properties and high uncertainties.

First, the structure and operating principle of the PMLSM are described in detail. Second, a field-oriented control PMLSM servo drive is introduced. Then, each segment of the multisegment switching surfaces is designed to match the corresponding part of the trapezoidal velocity profile, thus the motor dynamics on the specified-segment switching surface have the desired velocity or acceleration corresponding part of the trapezoidal velocity profile. In addition, the proposed control system is implemented in a PC-based computer control system.

Previous proposals required drastic increases in asymmetry and knowledge to work, whereas our protocol does not use any additional knowledge, and does not require more symmetry-breaking conditions than available; thus, it is also stabilizing with respect to dynamic changes in the topology. We prove an optimal quiescence time n + D for a synchronous network of n processors and diameter D; the protocol can be made finite state with a negligible loss in quiescence time. Moreover, an optimal D + 1 protocol is given for the case of unique identifiers. As a consequence, we provide an effective proof technique that allows one to show whether self-stabilization to a certain behaviour is possible under a wide range of models</title><text>We prove the existence of a "universal" synchronous self-stabilizing protocol,</text><keywords>universal dynamic synchronous self-stabilization;synchronous self-stabilizing protocol;distributed system;nonreactive behaviour;topology;dynamic changes;optimal quiescence time;synchronous network;finite state;quiescence time;unique identifiers;proof technique;self-stabilization</keywords></doc>

While play-off race statistics, such as games back and magic number, are informative, they are overly conservative and do not account for the remaining schedule of games. Using optimization techniques, one can model schedule effects explicitly and determine precisely when a team has secured a play-off spot or has been eliminated from contention. The RIOT Baseball Play-off Races Web site developed at the University of California, Berkeley, provides automatic updates of new, optimization-based play-off race statistics each day of the major league baseball season. In developing the site, we found that we could determine the first-place elimination status of all teams in a division using a single linear-programming formulation, since a minimum win threshold for teams finishing in first place applies to all teams in a division.

<doc><title>Multilayered image representation: application to image compression and image compression. We describe a new multilayered representation technique for images. An image is parsed into a superposition of coherent layers: piecewise smooth regions layer, textures layer, etc. The multilayered decomposition algorithm consists in a cascade of compressions applied successively to the image itself and to the residuals that resulted from the previous compressions. During each iteration of the algorithm, we code the residual part in a lossy way: we only retain the most significant structures of the residual part, which results in a sparse representation. Each layer is encoded independently with a different transform, or basis, at a different bitrate, and the combination of the compressed layers can always be reconstructed in a meaningful way. The strength of the multilayer approach comes from the fact that different sets of basis functions complement each others: some of the basis functions will give reasonable account of the large trend of the data, while others will catch the local transients, or the oscillatory patterns. This multilayered representation has a lot of beautiful applications in image understanding, and image and video coding. We have implemented the algorithm and we have studied its capabilities</title><text>The main contribution of this work is a new paradigm for image representation</text><keywords>image compression;multilayered representation;image representation;piecewise smooth regions layer;textures layer;multilayered decomposition algorithm;residual part;sparse representation;basis functions</keywords></doc>

This color plane interpolation is known as demosaicing; it is one of the important tasks in a digital camera pipeline. If demosaicing is not performed appropriately, images suffer from highly visible color artifacts. In this paper we present a new demosaicing technique that uses inter-channel correlation effectively in an alternating-projections scheme.

Layer-based machining has emerged as a promising method for integrated additive and subtractive shaping theory. In the paper, major layer-based machining systems are reviewed and compared according to characteristics of stock layers, numerical control machining configurations, stacking operations, input format and raw materials. Support structure, a major issue in machining-based systems which has seldom been addressed in previous research, is investigated in the paper with considerations of four situations: floating overhang, cantilever, vaulted overhang and ceiling. Except for the floating overhang where a support structure should not be overlooked, the necessity for support structures for the other three situations is determined by stress and deflection analysis.

<doc><title>A survey of interactive mesh-cutting techniques and a new method for implementing generalized interactive mesh cutting using virtual tools solutions address the following major issues: definition of the cut path, primitive removal and re-meshing, number of new primitives created, when re-meshing is performed, and representation of the cutting tool. Many researchers have developed schemes for interactive mesh cutting with the goals of reducing the number of new primitives created, creating new primitives with good aspect ratios, avoiding a disconnected mesh structure between primitives in the cut path, and representing the path traversed by the tool as accurately as possible. The goal of this paper is to explain how, by using a very simple framework, one can build a generalized cutting scheme. This method allows for any arbitrary cut to be made within a virtual object, and can simulate cutting surface, layered surface or tetrahedral objects using a virtual scalpel, scissors, or loop cautery tool. This method has been implemented in a real-time, haptic-rate surgical simulation system allowing arbitrary cuts to be made on high-resolution patient-specific models</title><text>In our experience, mesh-cutting methods can be distinguished by how their</text><keywords>generalized interactive mesh cutting;virtual tools;re-meshing;cutting tool;disconnected mesh structure;virtual object;tetrahedral objects;layered surface;haptic-rate surgical simulation system;high-resolution patient-specific models</keywords></doc>

We suggest that GA's can be used to search for possible fault components among a system of qualitative equations. The QBG is adopted as the modeling scheme to generate a set of qualitative equations. The qualitative bond graph provides a unified approach for modeling engineering systems, in particular, mechatronic systems. In order to demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm, we have tested the proposed algorithm on an in-house designed and built floating disc experimental setup. Results from fault diagnosis in the floating disc system are presented and discussed. Additional measurements will be required to localize the fault when more than one fault candidate is inferred.

It is known that outlier data vectors whose steering vector is highly correlated with the desired steering vector, can significantly degrade the performance of AMF algorithms such as sample matrix inversion (SMI) or fast maximum likelihood (FML). Four new algorithms that censor outliers are presented which are derived via approximation to the MLE solution. Two algorithms each are related to using the SMI or the FML to estimate the unknown underlying covariance matrix. Results are presented using computer simulations which demonstrate the relative effectiveness of the four algorithms versus each other and also versus the SMI and FML algorithms in the presence of outliers and no outliers. It is shown that one of the censoring algorithms, called the reiterative censored fast maximum likelihood (CFML) technique is significantly superior to the other three censoring methods in stressful outlier scenarios</title><text>Robust adaptive matched filtering (AMF) whereby outlier data vectors are</text><keywords>outlier resistant adaptive matched filtering;covariance matrix estimate;steering vector;sample matrix inversion;fast maximum likelihood;censoring algorithms;reiterative censored fast maximum likelihood</keywords></doc>

Each image is modeled as an additive composite of two component images that exhibit a spatial shift due to the binocular parallax. The segmentation is accomplished by decoupling each Fourier component in one of the resultant additive images into its two constituent phasors, allocating each to its appropriate object-specific spectrum, and then reconstructing the foreground and background using the inverse Fourier transform. It is shown that the foreground and background shifts can be computed from the differences of the magnitudes and phases of the Fourier transform of the binocular image pair.

In the past, the proposed method has been to check the characteristics independently by means of external measurement equipment. However, with the availability of different PC models and the rapid pace of model change, there is an urgent need for the development of convenient and accurate methods of checking. The method proposed consists of raising the precision of the PC's clock to the microsecond level and using a joystick connected to the MIDI terminal of a sound board to give the PC an independent timing function. Statistical processing of the data provided by this method makes it possible to estimate accurately the keyboard scanning interval time and the average keyboard delay time.

<doc><title>On batch-constructing B/sup +/-trees: algorithm and its performance evaluation or adding a new index to an existing database since both of them should handle an enormous volume of data. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for batch-constructing the B/sup +/-tree, the most widely used index structure in database systems. The main characteristic of our algorithm is to simultaneously process all the key values to be placed on each B+-tree page when accessing the page. This avoids the overhead due to accessing the same page multiple times, which results from applying the B+-tree insertion algorithm repeatedly. For performance evaluation, we have analyzed our algorithm in terms of the number of disk accesses. The results show that the number of disk accesses excluding those in the relocation process is identical to the number of pages belonging to the B/sup +/-tree. Considering that the relocation process is an unavoidable preprocessing step for batch-constructing of B/sup +/-trees, our algorithm requires just one disk access per B+-tree page, and therefore turns out to be optimal. We also present the performance tendency in relation with different parameter values via simulation. Finally, we show the performance enhancement effect of our algorithm, compared with the one using repeated insertions through experiments</title><text>Efficient construction of indexes is very important in bulk-loading a database</text><keywords>index structure;B+-tree page;B+-tree insertion algorithm;disk accesses;relocation process;simulation</keywords></doc>

Based on the concept of deindividuation, it was hypothesized that personal identifiability and group identity would be important factors that affect the perceptions and behavior of members of computer-mediated groups. The degree of personal identifiability and the strength of group identity were manipulated across groups of geographically dispersed computer users who took part in e-mail discussions during a 2-week period. The results do not support the association between deindividuation and uninhibited behavior cited in much previous research. Instead, the data provide some support for a social identity perspective of computer-mediated communication, which explains the higher levels uninhibited in identifiable computer-mediated groups. However, predictions based on social identity theory regarding group polarization and group cohesion were not supported.

<doc><title>Exploring developments in Web based relationship marketing within the hotel industry Web marketing by the hotel industry. There is a lack of historical perspective on industry related Web marketing applications and this paper attempts to resolve this with a two-year follow-up case study of the changing use of the Web to develop different types of relationships. Specifically, the aims are: (1) to identify key changes in the way hotels are using the Web; (2) to look for evidence of the adoption of a relationship marketing (RM) model as a strategy for the development of hotel Web sites and the use of new technologies; and, (3) To investigate the use of multimedia in hotel Web sites. The development and strategic exploitation of the Internet has transformed the basis of marketing. Using the evidence from a Web content survey this study reveals the way relationships are being created and managed within the hotel industry by its use of the Web as a marketing tool. The authors have collected evidence by means of a descriptive study on the way hotels build and create relationships with their Web presence delivering multimedia information as well as channel and interactive means of communication. In addition a strategic framework is offered as the means to describe the mechanism and orientation of Web based marketing by hotels. The study utilizes a model by Gilbert (1996) as a means of developing a measurement instrument to allow a content analysis of the current approach by hotels to the development of Web sites. The results indicate hotels are aware of the new uses of Web technology and are promoting hotel products in the global electronic market in new and sophisticated ways</title><text>This paper provides a content analysis study of the application of World Wide</text><keywords>Web based relationship marketing;hotel industry;hotel Web sites;multimedia;Web content survey;global electronic market</keywords></doc>
<doc><title>High-voltage transistor scaling circuit techniques for high-density negative-gate channel-erasing NOR flash memories channel-erasing NOR flash memories, two circuit techniques were developed. A proposed level shifter with low operating voltage is composed of three parts, a latch holding the negative erasing voltage, two coupling capacitors connected with the latched nodes in the latch, and high-voltage drivers inverting the latch, resulting in reduction of the maximum internal voltage by 0.5 V. A proposed high-voltage generator adds a path-gate logic to a conventional high-voltage generator to realize both low noise and low ripple voltage, resulting in a reduction of the maximum internal voltage by 0.5 V. As a result, these circuit techniques along with high coupling-ratio cell technology can scale down the high-voltage transistors by 15% and can realize higher density negative-gate channel-erase NOR flash memories in comparison with the source-erase NOR flash memories</title><text>In order to scale high-voltage transistors for high-density negative-gate</text><keywords>level shifter;high-voltage drivers;high-voltage generator;path-gate logic;low noise;low ripple voltage;high coupling-ratio cell technology</keywords></doc>

A knowledge-based top-down approach for image interpretation is used. The method is inspired by the manner in which a radiologist and radiotherapist interpret CT images before radiotherapy is planned. A two-dimensional followed by a three-dimensional analysis is performed. The algorithm first detects the thorax contour, the lungs and the ribs, which further help the detection of metastases. Thus, two types of tumors are detected: nodules and metastases located at the lung extremities. A method to visualize the anatomical structures segmented is also presented. The system was tested on 20 patients (988 total images) from the Oncology Department of La Chaux-de-Fonds Hospital and the results show that the method is reliable as a computer-aided diagnostic tool for clinical purpose in an oncology department</title><text>A solution to the problem of lung metastasis detection on computed tomography</text><keywords>lung metastasis detection;CT images;computed tomography;knowledge-based top-down approach;three-dimensional analysis;computer-aided diagnostic tool;oncology;thorax;image interpretation</keywords></doc>

These data for various dimensions of the raindrops (mean effective radius from 0 to 3.25 mm), frequencies (10 to 80 GHz), (horizontal and vertical) polarizations, and temperatures (0, 10 and 20 degrees C) are stored to establish a data bank. Furthermore, a curve fitting technique, i.e., interpolation of order 3, is implemented for the TCS values in the data bank. Therefore, the interpolated TCS results can be obtained readily from the interpolation process with negligible or even null computational time and efforts. Error analysis is carried out to show the high accuracy of the present analysis and applicability of the interpolation. At three operating frequencies of 15, 21.225, and 38 GHz locally used in Singapore, some new TCS values are obtained from the new fast and efficient interpolation with a good accuracy</title><text>A new computer program is developed based on the T-matrix method to generate a</text><keywords>extinction cross sections;realistic raindrops;data-bank;T-matrix method;temperature;error analysis;mean effective radius;gravity;vertical polarization;interpolation;operating frequencies;Singapore;computer program</keywords></doc>

However, most existing models of MCFC are not ready to be applied in synthesis. In the paper, a radial basis function neural networks identification model of a MCFC stack is developed based on the input-output sampled data. An adaptive fuzzy control procedure for the temperature of the MCFC stack is also developed. The parameters of the fuzzy control system are regulated by back-propagation algorithm, and the rule database of the fuzzy system is also adaptively adjusted by the nearest-neighbor-clustering algorithm. Finally using the neural networks model of MCFC stack, the simulation results of the control algorithm are presented.

These descriptors make use of a quantity named ZE-isomerism correction, which is added to the vertex degrees of atoms connected by double bonds in Z and E configurations. This approach is similar to the one described previously for topological chirality descriptors (Golbraikh, A., et al. J. Chem. Inf. Comput. Sci. 2001, 41, 147-158). The ZE-isomerism descriptors include modified molecular connectivity indices, overall Zagreb indices, extended connectivity, overall connectivity, and topological charge indices. They can be either real or complex numbers. Mathematical properties of different subgroups of ZE-isomerism descriptors are discussed. These descriptors circumvent the inability of conventional topological indices to distinguish between Z and E isomers.

An optimal routing policy is a policy that maximizes the probability of a message reaching its destination without delays. Optimal routing policies have been proposed for several regular networks, including the mesh and the hypercube. An open problem in interconnection network research has been the identification of an optimal routing policy for the torus. In this paper, we show that there is no optimal routing policy for the torus. Our result is demonstrated by presenting a detailed example in which the best choice of output channel is dependent on the probability of each channel being available.

The model developed herein using support vector machines, a powerful data-training algorithm, seeks to account for the impact of specific operating conditions, in addition to temperature variation, on the effective prediction of thermal errors. Several experiments were conducted to study the error pattern, which was found to change significantly with variation in operating conditions. This model attempts to classify the error based on operating conditions. Once classified, the error is then predicted based on the temperature states. This paper also briefly describes the concept of the implementation of such a comprehensive model along with an on-line error assessment and calibration system in a PC-based open-architecture controller environment, so that it could be employed in regular production for the purpose of periodic calibration of machine tools</title><text>This paper addresses a change in the concept of machine tool thermal error</text><keywords>support vector machines model;data-training algorithm;error pattern;PC-based open-architecture controller environment</keywords></doc>

The truth model is a full six-degree-of-freedom simulation provided by Calspan and General Dynamics. The design models are chosen as 13-state linearized models, including first order actuator models. Actuator failures are incorporated into the truth model and design model assuming a "failure to free stream." Filter spawning is used to include additional filters with partial actuator failure hypotheses into the MMAE bank. The spawned filters are based on varying degrees of partial failures (in terms of effectiveness) associated with the complete-actuaton-failure hypothesis with the highest conditional probability of correctness at the current time. Thus, a blended estimate of the failure effectiveness is found using the filters' estimates based upon a no-failure hypothesis, a complete actuator failure hypothesis, and the spawned filters' partial-failure hypotheses. This yields substantial precision in effectiveness estimation, compared with what is possible without spawning additional filters, making partial failure adaptation a viable methodology</title><text>Multiple model adaptive estimation (MMAE) with filter spawning is used to</text><keywords>multiple model adaptive estimation;filter spawning;partial actuator failures;VISTA F-16;truth model;six-degree-of-freedom simulation;Calspan;General Dynamics;linearized models;MMAE;partial failures;conditional probability;no-failure hypothesis</keywords></doc>

This technique decreases the reagent consumption (total reaction volume 0.75-1 mu L), the time requirement of the PCR (15-20 min) and subsequent ultrathin-layer gel electrophoresis based fragment analysis (5 min) by automating the current manual procedure and reducing the human intervention using sample loading robots and computerized real time data analysis.

<doc><title>Chemical information based scaling of molecular descriptors: a universal chemical scale for library design and analysis molecular topology when disparate descriptors are involved. To compare properties across different data sets, a common scale must be defined. Using several publicly available databases (ACD, CMC, MDDR, and NCI) as a basis, we propose to define chemically meaningful scales for a number of molecular properties and topology descriptors. These chemically derived scaling functions have several advantages. First, it is possible to define chemically relevant scales, greatly simplifying similarity and diversity analyses across data sets. Second, this approach provides a convenient method for setting descriptor boundaries that define chemically reasonable topology spaces. For example, descriptors can be scaled so that compounds with little potential for biological activity, bioavailability, or other drug-like characteristics are easily identified as outliers. We have compiled scaling values for 314 molecular descriptors. In addition the 10th and 90th percentile values for each descriptor have been calculated for use in outlier filtering</title><text>Scaling is a difficult issue for any analysis of chemical properties or</text><keywords>universal chemical scale;library design;chemical information based scaling;molecular descriptors;molecular topology;chemical properties;databases;diversity analyses;data sets;descriptor boundaries;drug-like characteristics;biological activity;bioavailability;outliers</keywords></doc>

First, a modified matched filter (MF) is applied to remove maternal cardiac interference; then, a simple signal space projection (SSP) is applied to remove noise. The key difference between our MF and a conventional one is that the interference template and the template scaling are derived from a signal that has been spatially filtered to isolate the interference, rather than from the raw signal. Unlike conventional MFs, ours is able to separate maternal and fetal cardiac complexes, even when they have similar morphology and overlap strongly.

<doc><title>The Open Archives Initiative: realizing simple and effective digital library interoperability library interoperability. Its focus has been on defining simple protocols, most recently for the exchange of metadata from archives. The OAI evolved out of a need to increase access to scholarly publications by supporting the creation of interoperable digital libraries. As a first step towards such interoperability, a metadata harvesting protocol was developed to support the streaming of metadata from one repository to another, ultimately to a provider of user services such as browsing, searching, or annotation.

<doc><title>Modeling self-consistent multi-class dynamic traffic flow traffic model derived from the vehicular Boltzmann equation and the traffic dispersion model. The multilane domain is considered as a two-dimensional space and the interaction among vehicles in the domain is described by a dispersion model. The reason we consider a multilane domain as a two-dimensional space is that the driving behavior of road users may not be restricted by lanes, especially motorcyclists. The dispersion model, which is a nonlinear Poisson equation, is derived from the car-following theory and the equilibrium assumption. Under the concept that all kinds of users share the finite section, the density is distributed on a road by the dispersion model. In addition, the dynamic evolution of the traffic flow is determined by the systematic gas-kinetic model derived from the Boltzmann equation. Multiplying Boltzmann equation by the zeroth, first- and second-order moment functions, integrating both side of the equation and using chain rules, we can derive continuity, motion and variance equation, respectively. However, the second-order moment function, which is the square of the individual velocity, is employed by previous researches does not have physical meaning in traffic flow</title><text>In this study, we present a systematic self-consistent multiclass multilane</text><keywords>vehicular Boltzmann equation;traffic dispersion model;road users;nonlinear Poisson equation;car-following theory;dynamic evolution;variance equation;Poisson equation</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>Loudspeaker voice-coil inductance losses: circuit models, parameter estimation, and effect on frequency response is shown that losses in an inductor require the ratio of the flux to MMF in the core to be frequency dependent. For small-signal operation, this dependence leads to a circuit model composed of a lossless inductor and a resistor in parallel, both of which are frequency dependent. Mathematical expressions for these elements are derived under the assumption that the ratio of core flux to MMF varies as omega /sup n-1/, where n is a constant. A linear regression technique is described for extracting the model parameters from measured data. Experimental data are presented to justify the model for the lossy inductance of a loudspeaker voice-coil.

<doc><title>A nonlinear modulation strategy for hybrid AC/DC power systems AC power system with several DC links terminated in the presence of large disturbances is presented. The approach proposed in this paper is based on differential geometric theory, and the HVDC systems are taken as a variable admittance connected at the inverter or rectifier AC bus. After deriving the analytical description of the relationship between the variable admittance and active power flows of each generator, the traditional generator dynamic equations can thus be expressed with the variable admittance of HVDC systems as an additional state variable and changed to an affine form, which is suitable for global linearization method being used to determine its control variable. An important feature of the proposed method is that, the modulated DC power is an adaptive and non-linear function of AC system states, and it can be realized by local feedback and less transmitted data from, adjacent generators. The design procedure is tested on a dual-infeed hybrid AC/DC system</title><text>A nonlinear control strategy to improve transient stability of a multi-machine</text><keywords>nonlinear control strategy;transient stability;DC links;nonlinear modulation strategy;hybrid AC/DC power systems;differential geometric theory;HVDC systems;variable admittance;inverter;rectifier AC bus;active power flows;generator dynamic equations;affine form;global linearization method;local feedback;adjacent generators;dual-infeed hybrid AC/DC system</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>Global stability of the attracting set of an enzyme-catalysed reaction system reaction rate on metabolite concentration taking the form of saturation kinetics. Recently, it has been shown that this feature is associated with the phenomenon of "loss of system coordination" (Liu, 1999). In this paper, we study a system of ordinary differential equations representing a branched biochemical system of enzyme-mediated reactions. We show that this system can become very sensitive to changes in certain maximum enzyme activities. In particular, we show that the system exhibits three distinct responses: a unique, globally-stable steady-state, large amplitude oscillations, and asymptotically unbounded solutions, with the transition between these states being almost instantaneous. It is shown that the appearance of large amplitude, stable limit cycles occurs due to a "false" bifurcation or canard explosion. The subsequent disappearance of limit cycles corresponds to the collapse of the domain of attraction of the attracting set for the system and occurs due to a global bifurcation in the flow, namely, a saddle connection. Subsequently, almost all nonnegative data become unbounded under the action of the dynamical system and correspond exactly to loss of system coordination. We discuss the relevance of these results to the possible consequences of modulating such systems</title><text>The essential feature of enzymatic reactions is a nonlinear dependency of</text><keywords>enzymatic reactions;nonlinear dependency;metabolite concentration;saturation kinetics;biochemical system;ordinary differential equations;enzyme-mediated reactions;saddle connection;stable limit cycles;bifurcation</keywords></doc>

Several improvement methods are studied to avoid the algorithm's huge time/space consumption problem. The algorithm runs about 100 times faster if these improvement methods are applied. Using this method fully automatic camera calibration is achieved without human interactive ROI specification.

Previous theoretical results are used to characterize the fundamental capacity limits of image watermarking and data-hiding systems. Capacity is determined by the statistical model used for the host image, by the distortion constraints on the data hider and the attacker, and by the information available to the data hider, to the attacker, and to the decoder. We consider autoregressive, block-DCT, and wavelet statistical models for images and compute data-hiding capacity for compressed and uncompressed host-image sources.

We use the topographical properties of the surface as well as the electrostatic potential, the local lipophilicity/hydrophilicity, and the hydrogen bond density on the surface for characterization. The definition and the calculation method for these properties are reviewed. The surface is segmented into overlapping patches with similar molecular properties. These patches can be used to represent the characteristic local features of the molecule in a way that is beyond the atomistic resolution but can nevertheless be applied for the analysis of partial similarities of different molecules as well as for the identification of molecular complementarity in a very general sense.

This hybrid method is much faster than the standard EM method and faster than the standard direct maximum likelihood method (ML, Newton-Raphson) for large samples. We have previously applied this method to semiparametric shared gamma frailty models, and verified by simulations the asymptotic and small sample statistical properties of the frailty variance estimates. Let theta /sub 0/ be the true value of the frailty variance parameter. Then the asymptotic distribution is normal for theta /sub 0/>0 while it is a 50-50 mixture between a point mass at zero and a normal random variable on the positive axis for theta /sub 0/=0. For small samples, simulations suggest that the frailty variance estimates are approximately distributed as an x-(100-x)% mixture, 0<or=x<or=50, between a point mass at zero and a normal random variable on the positive axis even for theta /sub 0/>0. We apply this method and verify by simulations these statistical results for semiparametric shared log-normal frailty models.

<doc><title>Three-dimensional particle image tracking for dilute particle-liquid flows in a pipe the coarse spherical particle-liquid flows in a pipe. The flow images from both the front view and the normal side view, which was reflected into the front view by a mirror, were recorded with a CCD camera and digitized by a PC with an image grabber card. An image processing program was developed to enhance and segment the flow image, and then to identify the particles. Over 90% of all the particles can be identified and located from the partially overlapped particle images using the circular Hough transform. Then the 3D position of each detected particle was determined by matching its front view image to its side view image. The particle velocity was then obtained by pairing its images in successive video fields. The measurements for the spherical expanded polystyrene particle-oil flows show that the particles, like the spherical bubbles in laminar bubbly flows, tend to conglomerate near the pipe wall and to line up to form the particle clusters. As liquid velocity decreases, the particle clusters disperse and more particles are distributed in the pipe centre region</title><text>A three-dimensional (3D) particle image tracking technique was used to study</text><keywords>three-dimensional particle image tracking;dilute particle-liquid flows;CCD camera;3D position;particle clusters;spherical bubble;Hough transform</keywords></doc>

Our stability conditions are based on Frazer-Duncan's theorem and all conditions can be checked using only endpoint values of interval parameters. These stability conditions are necessary and sufficient under the monotonicity assumptions. When the monotonicity conditions do not hold on the whole parameter region, we present an interval division method and a transformation algorithm in order to apply the monotonicity conditions.

That data, however, is a snapshot and does not include a customer's investment history. Also, because Web sites update data at different times, scraping them can provide an inaccurate picture of a customer's financial situation, making it difficult for reps seeking to provide timely and accurate advice. The objective is to access both fresh and historical data across a client's financial spectrum, from investments to checking accounts and loans to insurance policies, a Complete Customer balance sheet.

<doc><title>Secrets of the Glasgow Haskell compiler inliner abstractions by composing functions. A good compiler must inline many of these calls to recover an efficiently executable program. In principle, inlining is dead simple: just replace the call of a function by an instance of its body. But any compiler-writer will tell you that inlining is a black art, full of delicate compromises that work together to give good performance without unnecessary code bloat. The purpose of this paper is, therefore, to articulate the key lessons we learned from a full-scale "production" inliner, the one used in the Glasgow Haskell compiler. We focus mainly on the algorithmic aspects, but we also provide some indicative measurements to substantiate the importance of various aspects of the inliner</title><text>Higher-order languages such as Haskell encourage the programmer to build</text><keywords>Glasgow Haskell compiler inliner;higher-order languages;abstractions;executable program;performance;algorithmic aspects</keywords></doc>
<doc><title>An intelligent information gathering method for dynamic information mediators information infrastructures that are indispensable for our daily life. In particular, the WWW is widely used for various purposes such as sharing personal information, academic research, business work, and electronic commerce, and the amount of available information is increasing rapidly. We usually utilize information sources on the Internet as individual stand-alone sources, but if we can integrate them, we can add more value to each of them. Hence, information mediators, which integrate information distributed on the Internet, are drawing attention. In this paper, under the assumption that the information sources to be integrated are updated frequently and asynchronously, we propose an information gathering method that constructs an answer to a query from a user, accessing information sources to be integrated properly within an allowable time period. The proposed method considers the reliability of data in the cache and the quality of answer in order to efficiently access information sources and to provide appropriate answers to the user. As evaluation, we show the effectiveness of the proposed method by using an artificial information integration problem, in which some parameters can be modified, and a real-world flight information service compared with a conventional FIFO information gathering method</title><text>The Internet is spreading into our society rapidly and is becoming one of the</text><keywords>intelligent information gathering method;dynamic information mediators;Internet;information infrastructures;WWW;academic research;business work;electronic commerce;artificial information integration problem;real-world flight information service</keywords></doc>

In this study, 15 women who have work experience in several aspects of computing were asked about their reasons for entering computing, what they liked about working in computing, and what they disliked. While there are many common threads, there are also individual differences. Common reasons for choosing computing as a career included: exposure to computing in a setting which enabled them to see the versatility of computers; the influence of someone close to them; personal abilities which they perceived to be appropriate for a career in computing; and characteristics of such careers which appealed to them.

This technique can be implemented in a distributed distance learning environment, which allows students or instructors to login from anywhere to a central server in an education center while still retaining the look-and-feel of personal setups. In this research paper, we propose a distributed agent framework along with its communication messages to facilitate mobile personal agents, which serve three different groups of distance education users: instructors, students, and system administrators. We propose an agent communication framework as well as agent evolution states of mobile agents. The communication architecture and message transmission protocols are illustrated. The system is implemented on the Windows platform to support nomadic accessibility of remote distance learning users.

We explain how it is possible to use information contained in task models to support the design and development of effective user interfaces. Moreover, we show how task models can also support a systematic inspection-based usability assessment by examining possible deviations that can occur while users interact with the system, an important issue especially when coping with the peculiar requirements of safety-critical applications. Such evaluation provides useful technical documentation to help users achieve an in-depth understanding of the system and its design rationale. Lastly, a description of the application of our approach to a real case study in the air-traffic control domain will illustrate the main features of the proposed method.

Gartner Group, for example, recently reiterated its prediction that half the CM vendors in existence in mid-2001 would leave the marketplace by the end of 2002. Analysts consistently advise prospective CM buyers to tread carefully because their vendor may not stick around. But fortunately, the story goes, fewer vendor choices will finally bring greater clarity and sharper differentiators to this otherwise very messy product landscape. In fact, the number of CM vendors continues to rise. Industry growth has come through greater demand among CM buyers, but also expanding product functionality as well as successful partnerships. The marketplace certainly cannot sustain its current breadth of vendors in the long run, yet it remains unclear when and how any serious industry consolidation will occur.

A traditional way to study the value of differential games is through discrete time approximations. Here, we follow the opposite approach: We identify the limit value of a repeated game in discrete time as the value of a differential game. Namely, we use the recursive structure for the finitely repeated version of the dual game to construct a differential game for which the upper values of the uniform discretization satisfy precisely the same property. The value of the dual differential game exists and is the unique viscosity solution of a first-order derivative equation with a limit condition.

<doc><title>Hybrid fuzzy modeling of chemical processes without any priori information. However, the performance of conventional fuzzy models can be very poor in the case of insufficient training data due to their poor extrapolation capacity. In order to overcome this problem, a hybrid grey-box fuzzy modeling approach is proposed in this paper to combine expert experience, local linear models and historical data into a uniform framework. It consists of two layers. The expert fuzzy model constructed from linguistic information, the local linear model and the T-S type fuzzy model constructed from data are all put in the first layer. Layer 2 is a fuzzy decision module that is used to decide which model in the first layer should be employed to make the final prediction. The output of the second layer is the output of the hybrid fuzzy model. With the help of the linguistic information, the poor extrapolation capacity problem caused by sparse training data for conventional fuzzy models can be overcome.

This new method divides the FACTS device output region into several parts and selects one typical value from each part, which is called output candidate. Then, an intelligent optimal sieve is constructed, which predicts the impacts of each output candidate on a power system and sieves out an optimal output from all of the candidates. The artificial neural network technologies and fuzzy methods are applied to build the intelligent sieve. Finally, the real control signal of FACTS devices is calculated according to the selected optimal output through inverse system method.

<doc><title>Ten years of strategies to increase participation of women in computing programs. The Central Queensland University experience: 1999-2001 courses in most Australian Universities was around 25%. This low level of women's participation in computing courses occurs not only in Australia but also overseas. More studies indicate that the participation rates have not improved and in fact may be even further in decline. Participation rates in the workforce also appear to be in decline. Concerned at the imbalance within Australia, the Federal government directed all Australian Universities to increase the number of women in courses leading to a professional computing qualification (i.e., information technology courses) to 40% of students by 1995. This paper details one Australian university's approach, over a 10 year period (1991-2001), to redress this imbalance. We provide examples of intervention strategies developed and the outcomes for these strategies. We present the outcomes against a background frame of the Australian Higher Education scene of that decade which was influenced by funding levels to universities in general and to equity programs in particular.

<doc><title>A self-organizing context-based approach to the tracking of multiple robot trajectories to learn and recall complex spatiotemporal sequences. In such sequences, a particular item may occur more than once or the sequence may share states with another sequence. Processing of repeated/shared states is a hard problem that occurs very often in the domain of robotics. The proposed model consists of two groups of synaptic weights: competitive interlayer and Hebbian intralayer connections, which are responsible for encoding respectively the spatial and temporal features of the input sequence. Three additional mechanisms allow the network to deal with shared states: context units, neurons disabled from learning, and redundancy used to encode sequence states. The network operates by determining the current and the next state of the learned sequences. The model is simulated over various sets of robot trajectories in order to evaluate its storage and retrieval abilities; its sequence sampling effects; its robustness to noise and its tolerance to fault</title><text>We have combined competitive and Hebbian learning in a neural network designed</text><keywords>self-organizing context-based approach;Hebbian learning;complex spatiotemporal sequences;synaptic weights;Hebbian intralayer connections;shared states;context units;sequence states;robot trajectories;retrieval abilities;sequence sampling effects</keywords></doc>
<doc><title>Hybrid decision tree proposed. HDT simulates human reasoning by using symbolic learning to do qualitative analysis and using neural learning to do subsequent quantitative analysis. It generates the trunk of a binary HDT according to the binary information gain ratio criterion in an instance space defined by only original unordered attributes. If unordered attributes cannot further distinguish training examples falling into a leaf node whose diversity is beyond the diversity-threshold, then the node is marked as a dummy node. After all those dummy nodes are marked, a specific feedforward neural network named FANNC that is trained in an instance space defined by only original ordered attributes is exploited to accomplish the learning task. Moreover, this paper distinguishes three kinds of incremental learning tasks. Two incremental learning procedures designed for example-incremental learning with different storage requirements are provided, which enables HDT to deal gracefully with data sets where new data are frequently appended. Also a hypothesis-driven constructive induction mechanism is provided, which enables HDT to generate compact concept descriptions</title><text>In this paper, a hybrid learning approach named hybrid decision tree (HDT) is</text><keywords>hybrid decision tree;hybrid learning approach;reasoning;symbolic learning;qualitative analysis;neural learning;quantitative analysis;binary information gain ratio criterion;feedforward neural network;FANNC;incremental learning;storage requirements;data sets;hypothesis-driven constructive induction</keywords></doc>

This study reports the use of image fusion between (18)F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography (/sup 18/FDG-PET) and magnetic resonance imaging/computed tomography (MRI/CT) for better targets delineation in radiotherapy planning of head-and-neck cancers. The subjects consisted of 12 patients with oropharyngeal carcinoma and 9 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) who were treated with radical radiotherapy between July 1999 and February 2001. Image fusion between /sup 18/FDG-PET and MRI/CT was performed using an automatic multimodality image registration algorithm, which used the brain as an internal reference for registration. Gross tumor volume (GTV) was determined based on clinical examination and /sup 18/FDG uptake on the fusion images. Clinical target volume (CTV) was determined following the usual pattern of lymph node spread for each disease entity along with the clinical presentation of each patient. Except for 3 cases with superficial tumors, all the other primary tumors were detected by /sup 18/FDG-PET. The GTV volumes for primary tumors were not changed by image fusion in 19 cases (89%), increased by 49% in one NPC, and decreased by 45% in another NPC. Normal tissue sparing was more easily performed based on clearer GTV and CTV determination on the fusion images. In particular, parotid sparing became possible in 15 patients (71%) whose upper neck areas near the parotid glands were tumor-free by /sup 18/FDG-PET. Within a mean follow-up period of 18 months, no recurrence occurred in the areas defined as CTV, which was treated prophylactically, except for 1 patient who experienced nodal recurrence in the CTV and simultaneous primary site recurrence. In conclusion, this preliminary study showed that image fusion between /sup 18/FDG-PET and MRI/CT was useful in GTV and CTV determination in conformal RT, thus sparing normal tissues</title><text>Accurate diagnosis of tumor extent is important in three-dimensional conformal</text><keywords>image fusion;/sup 18/FDG-PET;MRI/CT;radiotherapy planning;nasopharyngeal carcinomas;oropharyngeal carcinomas;parotid glands;simultaneous primary site recurrence;normal tissues sparing;superficial tumors;primary tumors</keywords></doc>

It is argued that enhanced product support requires new technology solutions both for product manuals and for their authoring and presentation. The concept and the architecture of intelligent product manuals are then discussed. A prototype system called ProARTWeb is presented to demonstrate advanced features of intelligent product manuals. Next, the problem of producing such manuals in a cost-effective way is addressed and a concurrent engineering approach to their authoring is proposed.

In addition, Pipe and Menon's weight (MRM 1999;41:179-186) is also used in the reconstructions to make a comparison.

Our analysis first undertakes fusion of possible loop nests intra-procedurally and then performs loop distribution. The analysis discovers the closeness factor of two statements which is a quantitative measure of data traffic saved per unit memory occupied if the statements were under the same loop nest over the case where they are under different loop nests. We then develop a greedy algorithm which traverses the program dependence graph to group statements together under the same loop nest legally to promote maximal reuse per unit of memory occupied. We implemented our framework in Petit, a tool for dependence analysis and loop transformations. We compared our method with one based on tiling of fused loop nest and one based on a greedy strategy to purely maximize reuse. We show that our methods work better than both of these strategies in most cases for processors such as TMS320Cxx, which have a very limited amount of on-chip memory. The improvements in data I/O range from 10 to 30 percent over tiling and from 10 to 40 percent over maximal reuse for JPEG loops</title><text>In this paper, we propose a framework for analyzing the flow of values and</text><keywords>loop restructuring;data I/O minimization;on-chip memory;data traffic;embedded processors;program dependence graph;Petit;fused loop nest;closeness factor</keywords></doc>

Rational choice theory requires that participants should eventually allocate all their responses to the high-payoff alternative, but previous research has found that people fail to maximize their payoffs. Instead, it is commonly observed that people match their response probabilities to the payoff probabilities. We report three experiments on this choice anomaly using a simple probability learning task in which participants were provided with (i) large financial incentives, (ii) meaningful and regular feedback, and (iii) extensive training. In each experiment large proportions of participants adopted the optimal response strategy and all three of the factors mentioned above contributed to this.

This article considers the problem of minimizing the number of successor states of a given state in the reduced LTS. The problem can be solved by constructing an and/or-graph with weighted vertices and by finding a set of vertices that satisfies a certain constraint such that no set of vertices satisfying the constraint has a smaller sum of weights. Without weights, the and/or-graph can be constructed in low-degree polynomial time w.r.t. the length of the input of the problem. However, since actions can be nondeterministic and transitions can share target states, it is not known whether the weights are generally computable in polynomial time. Consequently, it is an open problem whether minimizing the number of successor states is as "easy" as minimizing the number of successor transitions</title><text>Combinatorial explosion which occurs in parallel compositions of LTSs can be</text><keywords>stubborn set method;combinatorial explosion;weighted vertices;low-degree polynomial time</keywords></doc>

The implementation of this library presents the challenge that all data types, data kinds, array ranks and input distributions need to be supported. For instance, more than 2 billion separate functions are required to support COPY-SCATTER fully. The efficient support of these billions of specific functions is one of the outstanding problems of HPF. We have solved this problem by developing a library generator which utilizes the mechanism of parameterized templates. This mechanism allows the procedures to be instantiated at compile time for arguments with a specific type, kind, rank and distribution over a specific processor array. We describe the algorithms used in the different library functions. The implementation gives the ease of generating a large number of library routines from a single template. The templates can be extended with special code for specific combinations of the input arguments.

This identification can be difficult for unexpected noise with unknown, time-varying band characteristics. The new model combines the local frequency-band information based on the union of random events, to reduce the dependence of the model on information about the noise. This model partially accomplishes the target: offering robustness to partial frequency-band corruption, while requiring no information about the noise. This paper introduces the theory and implementation of the union model, and is focused on several important advances. These new developments include a new algorithm for automatic order selection, a generalization of the modeling principle to accommodate partial feature stream corruption, and a combination of the union model with conventional noise reduction techniques to deal with a mixture of stationary noise and unknown, nonstationary noise. For the evaluation, we used the TIDIGITS database for speaker-independent connected digit recognition. The utterances were corrupted by various types of additive noise, stationary or time-varying, assuming no knowledge about the noise characteristics. The results indicate that the new model offers significantly improved robustness in comparison to other models</title><text>This paper introduces a new statistical approach, namely the probabilistic</text><keywords>robust speech recognition;probabilistic union models;automatic order selection;modeling;partial feature stream corruption;noise reduction techniques;stationary noise;nonstationary noise;TIDIGITS database;speaker-independent connected digit recognition;additive noise;noise characteristics;missing feature theory;noisy bands;time-varying band characteristics;local frequency-band information;partial frequency-band corruption</keywords></doc>

This paper presents a notion of knowledge flow and the related management mechanism for realizing an ordered knowledge sharing and cognitive cooperation in a geographically distributed team software development process. The knowledge flow can carry and accumulate knowledge when it goes through from one team member to another. The coordination between the knowledge flow process and the workflow process of a development team provides a new way to improve traditional team software development processes.

<doc><title>Modeling cutting temperatures for turning inserts with various tool geometries and materials thermal softening or temperature-activated wear. Many models for cutting temperatures have been developed, but these models consider only simple tool geometries such as a rectangular slab with a sharp corner. This report describes a finite element study of tool temperatures in cutting that accounts for tool nose radius and included angle effects. A temperature correction factor model that can be used in the design and selection of inserts is developed to account for these effects. A parametric mesh generator is used to generate the finite element models of tool and inserts of varying geometries. The steady-state temperature response is calculated using NASTRAN solver. Several finite element analysis (FEA) runs are performed to quantify the effects of inserts included angle, nose radius, and materials for the insert and the tool holder on the cutting temperature at the insert rake face. The FEA results are then utilized to develop a temperature correction factor model that accounts for these effects. The temperature correction factor model is integrated with an analytical temperature model for rectangular inserts to predict cutting temperatures for contour turning with inserts of various shapes and nose radii. Finally, experimental measurements of cutting temperature using the tool-work thermocouple technique are performed and compared with the predictions of the new temperature model. The comparisons show good agreement</title><text>Temperatures are of interest in machining because cutting tools often fail by</text><keywords>turning inserts;machining;tool nose radius;parametric mesh generator;finite element models;temperature correction factor;tool geometries</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>Expert advice - how can my organisation take advantage of reverse auctions without jeopardising existing supplier relationships? to negotiate prices with suppliers typically achieve savings of between 10% and 15% on direct goods and between 20% and 25% on indirect goods, and can slash sourcing cycle times from months to weeks. Suppliers, however, are less enthusiastic. They believe that these savings are achieved only by stripping the human element out of negotiations and evaluating bids on price alone, which drives down their profit margins. As a result, reverse auctions carry the risk of jeopardising long-term and trusted relationships. Suppliers that have not been involved in a reverse auction before typically fear the bidding event itself - arguably the most theatrical and, therefore, most hyped-up part of the process. Although it may only last one hour, weeks of preparation go into setting up a successful bidding event</title><text>In a recent survey, AMR Research found that companies that use reverse auctions</text><keywords>reverse auctions;supplier relationships;preparation</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>Efficient parallel programming on scalable shared memory systems with High Performance Fortran shared memory (SMP) architectures. It provides the user with simple work-sharing directives while it relies on the compiler to generate parallel programs based on thread parallelism. However, the lack of language features for exploiting data locality often results in poor performance since the non-uniform memory access times on scalable SMP machines cannot be neglected. High Performance Fortran (HPF), the de-facto standard for data parallel programming, offers a rich set of data distribution directives in order to exploit data locality, but it has been mainly targeted towards distributed memory machines. In this paper we describe an optimized execution model for HPF programs on SMP machines that avails itself with mechanisms provided by OpenMP for work sharing and thread parallelism, while exploiting data locality based on user-specified distribution directives. Data locality does not only ensure that most memory accesses are close to the executing threads and are therefore faster, but it also minimizes synchronization overheads, especially in the case of unstructured reductions. The proposed shared memory execution model for HPF relies on a small set of language extensions, which resemble the OpenMP work-sharing features. These extensions, together with an optimized shared memory parallelization and execution model, have been implemented in the ADAPTOR HPF compilation system and experimental results verify the efficiency of the chosen approach</title><text>OpenMP offers a high-level interface for parallel programming on scalable</text><keywords>parallel programming;scalable shared memory;High Performance Fortran</keywords></doc>
<doc><title>Comparison of automated digital elevation model extraction results using along-track ASTER and across-track SPOT stereo images satellite images. During the past decade, the most common satellite data used to extract DEM was the across-track SPOT. Recently, the addition of along-track ASTER data, which can be downloaded freely, provides another attractive alternative to extract DEM data. This work compares the automated DEM extraction results using an ASTER stereo pair and a SPOT stereo pair over an area of hilly mountains in Drum Mountain, Utah, when compared to a USGS 7.5-min DEM standard product. The result shows that SPOT produces better DEM results in terms of accuracy and details, if the radiometric variations between the images, taken on subsequent satellite revolutions, are small. Otherwise, the ASTER stereo pair is a better choice because of simultaneous along-track acquisition during a single pass. Compared to the USGS 7.5-min DEM, the ASTER and the SPOT extracted DEMs have a standard deviation of 11.6 and 4.6 m, respectively</title><text>A digital elevation model (DEM) can be extracted automatically from stereo</text><keywords>automated digital elevation model extraction;along-track ASTER data;across-track SPOT stereo images;ASTER stereo pair;radiometric variations;simultaneous along-track acquisition</keywords></doc>

We present our design using a source-level instrumentation approach based on OpenMP directive rewriting. Rules to instrument each directive and their combination are applied to generate calls to the interface consistent with directive semantics and to pass context information (e.g., source code locations) in a portable and efficient way. Our proposed OpenMP performance API further allows user functions and arbitrary code regions to be marked and performance measurement to be controlled using new OpenMP directives. To prototype the proposed OpenMP performance interface, we have developed compatible performance libraries for the EXPERT automatic event trace analyzer [17, 18] and the TAU performance analysis framework [13]. The directive instrumentation transformations we define are implemented in a source-to-source translation tool called OPARI. Application examples are presented for both EXPERT and TAU to show the OpenMP performance interface and OPARI instrumentation tool in operation. When used together with the MPI profiling interface (as the examples also demonstrate), our proposed approach provides a portable and robust solution to performance analysis of OpenMP and mixed-mode (OpenMP + MPI) applications</title><text>This paper proposes a performance tools interface for OpenMP, similar in spirit</text><keywords>performance tool interface;MPI profiling interface;API;source-level instrumentation approach;OpenMP directive rewriting;directive semantics;arbitrary code regions;performance libraries;EXPERT automatic event trace analyzer;TAU performance analysis framework;source-to-source translation tool;OPARI</keywords></doc>

By attaching a density function to each particle as its attribute, the diffusion of smoke can be described by the variation of particles' density functions, along with the effect on airflow by controlling particles' movement and fragmentation. In addition, a continuous density field for realistic rendering can be generated quickly through the look-up tables of particle's density functions. Compared with traditional particle systems, this approach can describe smoke diffusion, and provide a continuous density field for realistic rendering with much less computation. A quick rendering scheme is also presented in this paper as a useful preview tool for tuning appropriate parameters in the smoke model</title><text>A smoke simulation approach based on the integration of traditional particle</text><keywords>hybrid model;smoke simulation;density functions;continuous density field;rendering;look-up tables</keywords></doc>

In an attempt to characterize the P/sub 2/-property, they raised the following two questions: (i) Does the strong monotonicity imply the P/sub 2/-property? (ii) Does the GUS-property imply the P/sub 2/-property? In this paper, we show that the strong monotonicity property implies the P/sub 2/-property for any linear transformation and describe an equivalence between these two properties for Lyapunov and other transformations.

<doc><title>Failures and successes: notes on the development of electronic cash America's most comprehensive experiment to introduce electronic cash and, in the process, replace physical cash for casual, low-value payments. The technology used was Mondex, and its implementation was supported by all the country's major banks. It was launched with an extensive publicity campaign to promote Mondex not only in the domestic but also in the global market, for which the Canadian implementation was to serve as a "showcase." However, soon after the start of the first field test it became apparent that the new technology did not work smoothly. On the contrary, it created a host of controversies, in areas as varied as computer security, consumer privacy, and monetary policy. In the following years, few of these controversies could be resolved and Mondex could not be established as a widely used payment mechanism. In 2001, the experiment was finally terminated. Using the concepts developed in recent science and technology studies (STS), the article analyzes these controversies as resulting from the difficulties of fitting electronic cash, a new sociotechnical system, into the complex setting of the existing payment system. The story of Mondex not only offers lessons on why technologies fail, but also offers insight into how short-term failures can contribute to long-term transformations. This suggests the need to rethink the dichotomy of success and failure</title><text>Between 1997 and 2001, two mid-sized communities in Canada hosted North</text><keywords>electronic cash;Canada;low-value payments;Mondex;major banks;publicity campaign;global market;Canadian implementation;computer security;consumer privacy;monetary policy;payment mechanism;science and technology studies;sociotechnical system;short-term failures;long-term transformations</keywords></doc>

It is based on a dynamic strand space model, which enhances the original strand space model by introducing active nodes on strands so as to characterize the dynamic procedure of protocol execution. With exact causal dependency relations between messages considered in the model, this algorithm can avoid state space explosion caused by asynchronous composition. In order to get a finite state space, a new method called strand-added on demand is exploited, which extends a bundle in an incremental manner without requiring explicit configuration of protocol execution parameters. A finer granularity model of term structure is also introduced, in which subterms are divided into check subterms and data subterms. Moreover, data subterms can be further classified based on the compatible data subterm relation to obtain automatically the finite set of valid acceptable terms for an honest principal. In this algorithm, terms core is designed to represent the intruder's knowledge compactly, and forward search technology is used to simulate attack patterns easily. Using this algorithm, a new attack on the Dolve-Yao protocol can be found, which is even more harmful because the secret is revealed before the session terminates</title><text>This paper proposes an automatic attack construction algorithm in order to find</text><keywords>attack-finding algorithm;security protocols;dynamic strand space model;strand space model;state space explosion;asynchronous composition;strand-added on demand;check subterms;data subterms;Dolve-Yao protocol</keywords></doc>

A common aspect of such applications is the transmission of video streams that require a sustained relatively high bandwidth with stringent requirements of quality of service. In this paper various original algorithms for evaluating, in a video distribution system, a statistical estimation of aggregate bandwidth needed by a given number of smoothed video streams are proposed and discussed. The variable bit rate traffic generated by each video stream is characterized by its marginal distribution and by conditional probabilities between rates of temporary closed streams. The developed iterative algorithms evaluate an upper and lower bound of needed bandwidth for guaranteeing a given loss probability. The obtained results are compared with simulations and with other results, based on similar assumptions, already presented in the literature. Some considerations on the developed algorithms are made, in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed methods</title><text>Multimedia applications like video on demand, distance learning, Internet video</text><keywords>aggregate bandwidth estimation;stored video distribution systems;multimedia applications;video on demand;distance learning;broadband networks;quality of service;statistical estimation;variable bit rate traffic;marginal distribution;conditional probabilities;temporary closed streams;iterative algorithms;lower bound;loss probability;simulations</keywords></doc>

A benefit of source separation is that it overcomes the conventional cross-talk or leakage problem of adaptive beamforming. Beamforming on the other hand exploits geometric information which is often readily available but not utilized in blind algorithms. We propose to join these benefits by combining cross-power minimization of second-order source separation with geometric linear constraints used in adaptive beamforming. We find that the geometric constraints resolve some of the ambiguities inherent in the independence criterion such as frequency permutations and degrees of freedom provided by additional sensors. We demonstrate the new method in performance comparisons for actual room recordings of two and three simultaneous acoustic sources</title><text>Convolutive blind source separation and adaptive beamforming have a similar</text><keywords>geometric source separation;geometric beamforming;convolutive blind source separation;adaptive beamforming;cross-talk;leakage problem;blind algorithms;cross-power minimization;second-order source separation;geometric linear constraints;frequency permutations;degrees of freedom;sensors;room recordings;acoustic sources</keywords></doc>

Tools and results of multivariable statistics are used to show that, under a variety of assumed distributions on the elements, square processes of higher dimension tend to be more difficult to identify and control, whereas the expected controllability and identifiability of nonsquare processes depends on the relative numbers of measured and manipulated variables.

Data acquisition techniques from computer vision, such as stereo range images and space carving, produce 3D point sets that are imprecise and nonuniform when compared to laser or optical range scanners. Traditional reconstruction algorithms designed for dense and precise data do not produce smooth reconstructions when applied to vision-based data sets. Our method constructs a 3D implicit surface, formulated as a sum of weighted radial basis functions. We achieve three primary advantages over existing algorithms: (1) the implicit functions we construct estimate the surface well in regions where there is little data, (2) the reconstructed surface is insensitive to noise in data acquisition because we can allow the surface to approximate, rather than exactly interpolate, the data, and (3) the reconstructed surface is locally detailed, yet globally smooth, because we use radial basis functions that achieve multiple orders of smoothness</title><text>We present a new method of surface reconstruction that generates smooth and</text><keywords>surfaces reconstruction;volumetric regularization;radial basis functions;low resolution range data;data acquisition techniques;computer vision;stereo range images;space carving;3D point sets;vision-based data sets;3D implicit surface;weighted radial basis functions</keywords></doc>
<doc><title>Modeling and simulation of an ABR flow control algorithm using a virtual source/virtual destination switch networks uses a feedback control mechanism to adapt to varying link capacities. The virtual source/virtual destination (VS/VD) technique offers the possibility of segmenting the otherwise end-to-end ABR control loop into separate loops. The improved feedback delay and control of ABR traffic inside closed segments provide a better performance for ABR connections. This article presents the use of classical linear control theory to model and develop an ABR VS/VD flow control algorithm. Discrete event simulations are used to analyze the behavior of the algorithm with respect to transient behavior and correctness of the control model. Linear control theory offers the means to derive correct choices of parameters and to assess performance issues, such as stability of the system, during the design phase. The performance goals are high link utilization, fair bandwidth distribution, and robust operation in various environments, which are verified by discrete event simulations. The major contribution of this work is the use of analytic methods (linear control theory) to model and design an ABR flow control algorithm tailored for the special layout of a VS/VD switch, and the use of simulation techniques to verify the result</title><text>The available bit rate (ABR) service class of asynchronous transfer mode</text><keywords>modeling;ABR flow control algorithm;virtual source/virtual destination switch;feedback control mechanism;link capacities;control loop;feedback delay;closed segments;classical linear control theory;discrete event simulations;transient behavior;control model;performance issues;stability;high link utilization;fair bandwidth distribution;robust operation</keywords></doc>

The learned manifold must approximate the true manifold well, both geometrically and topologically, when the sampling density is sufficiently high. The proposed algorithm constructs a simplicial complex based on approximations to the tangent bundle of the manifold. An important property of the algorithm is that its complexity depends on the dimension of the manifold, rather than that of the embedding space. Successful examples are presented in the cases of learning curves in the plane, curves in space, and surfaces in space; in addition, a case when the algorithm fails is analyzed</title><text>An algorithm for manifold learning is presented.

As a result, the various replica control protocols that exist today in traditional distributed and multidatabase environments are no longer suitable. To solve this problem, a new mobile database replication scheme, the Transaction-Level Result-Set Propagation (TLRSP) model, is put forward in this paper. The conflict detection and resolution strategy based on TLRSP is discussed in detail, and the implementation algorithm is proposed. In order to compare the performance of the TLRSP model with that of other mobile replication schemes, we have developed a detailed simulation model. Experimental results show that the TLRSP model provides an efficient support for replicated mobile database systems by reducing reprocessing overhead and maintaining database consistency</title><text>In mobile database systems, mobility of users has a significant impact on data</text><keywords>mobile database;multidatabase;mobile database replication;Transaction-Level Result-Set Propagation</keywords></doc>
<doc><title>Detection and estimation of abrupt changes in the variability of a process parallel problem of detecting changes in variance has had less attention. The form of the generalized likelihood ratio test statistic has long been known, but its null distribution resisted exact analysis. In this paper, we formulate the change-point problem for a sequence of chi-square random variables. We describe a procedure that is exact for the distribution of the likelihood ratio statistic for all even degrees of freedom, and gives upper and lower bounds for odd (and also for non-integer) degrees of freedom. Both the liberal and conservative bounds for chi /sub 1//sup 2/ degrees of freedom are shown through simulation to be reasonably tight. The important problem of testing for change in the normal variance of individual observations corresponds to the chi /sub 1//sup 2/ case. The non-null case is also covered, and confidence intervals for the true change point are derived. The methodology is illustrated with an application to quality control in a deep level gold mine. Other applications include ambulatory monitoring of medical data and econometrics</title><text>Detection of change-points in normal means is a well-studied problem.

This filtering consists in extracting the principal components of the contextual covariance matrix, which is the covariance matrix of a sequence of vectors expanded by their context. We apply this new filtering in the framework of closed-set speaker identification, using a subset of the POLYCOST database.

The first controller is obtained using fuzzy logic (FL) only, whereas the second one by using a combination of FL, genetic algorithms and neural networks. The aim of the proposed controller(s) is to restore in a very smooth way the frequency to its nominal value in the shortest time possible whenever there is any change in the load demand etc. The action of these controller(s) provides a satisfactory balance between frequency overshoot and transient oscillations with zero steady-state error. The design and performance evaluation of the proposed controller(s) structure are illustrated with the help of case studies applied (without loss of generality) to a typical single-area power system.

This sequence provides an effective tradeoff between spatial and temporal resolution and reduces image distortion and signal dropout. The blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD)-weighted fMRI signal can be reliably obtained in the region of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). To overcome physiological motion artifacts during prolonged multisegment EPI acquisition, two sets of navigator echoes were acquired in both the readout and phase-encoding directions. Ghost artifacts generally produced by single-shot EPI acquisition were eliminated by separately placing the even and odd echoes in different k-space trajectories. Unlike most z-shim methods that focus on increasing temporal resolution for event-related functional brain mapping, the MESBAC sequence simultaneously addresses problems of image distortion and signal dropout while maintaining sufficient temporal resolution. The MESBAC sequence will be particularly useful for pharmacological and affective fMRI studies in brain regions such as the OFC, nucleus accumbens, amygdala, para-hippocampus, etc</title><text>A MultiEcho Segmented EPI with z-shimmed BAckground gradient Compensation</text><keywords>fMRI;multiecho segmented EPI;z-shimmed background gradient compensation;severe susceptibility artifacts;orbitofrontal cortex;navigator echoes;ghost artifacts;event-related functional brain mapping;signal dropout;temporal resolution;image distortion</keywords></doc>
<doc><title>Deadlock-free scheduling in flexible manufacturing systems using Petri nets Manufacturing Systems. An efficient deadlock-free scheduling algorithm was developed, using timed Petri nets, for a class of FMSs called Systems of Sequential Systems with Shared Resources (S/sup 4/ R). The algorithm generates a partial reachability graph to find the optimal or near-optimal deadlock-free schedule in terms of the firing sequence of the transitions of the Petri net model. The objective is to minimize the mean flow time (MFT). An efficient truncation technique, based on the siphon concept, has been developed and used to generate the minimum necessary portion of the reachability graph to be searched. It has been shown experimentally that the developed siphon truncation technique enhances the ability to develop deadlock-free schedules of systems with a high number of deadlocks, which cannot be achieved using standard Petri net scheduling approaches. It may be necessary, in some cases, to relax the optimality condition for large FMSs in order to make the search effort reasonable. Hence, a User Control Factor (UCF) was defined and used in the scheduling algorithm. The objective of using the UCF is to achieve an acceptable trade-off between the solution quality and the search effort. Its effect on the MFT and the CPU time has been investigated. Randomly generated examples are used for illustration and comparison. Although the effect of UCF did not affect the mean flow time, it was shown that increasing it reduces the search effort (CPU time) significantly</title><text>This paper addresses the deadlock-free scheduling problem in Flexible</text><keywords>flexible manufacturing systems;deadlock-free scheduling;Petri nets;systems of sequential systems with shared resources;partial reachability graph;near-optimal deadlock-free schedule;siphon truncation technique;user control factor;CPU time;randomly generated examples</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>Numerical approximation of nonlinear BVPs by means of BVMs solution of nonlinear Boundary Value Problems (BVPs). They have been successfully used for solving linear BVPs together with a mesh selection strategy based on the conditioning of the linear systems. Our aim is to extend this approach so as to use them for the numerical approximation of nonlinear problems. For this reason, we consider the quasi-linearization technique that is an application of the Newton method to the nonlinear differential equation. Consequently, each iteration requires the solution of a linear BVP. In order to guarantee the convergence to the solution of the continuous nonlinear problem, it is necessary to determine how accurately the linear BVPs must be solved. For this goal, suitable stopping criteria on the residual and on the error for each linear BVP are given. Numerical experiments on stiff problems give rather satisfactory results, showing that the experimental code, called TOM, that uses a class of BVMs and the quasi-linearization technique, may be competitive with well known solvers for BVPs</title><text>Boundary Value Methods (BVMs) would seem to be suitable candidates for the</text><keywords>numerical approximation;nonlinear boundary value problems;boundary value methods;mesh selection strategy;quasi-linearization technique;Newton method;nonlinear differential equation;stopping criteria;stiff problems;BVMs</keywords></doc>

Our model employs the reinforcement learning paradigm and a temporal-difference algorithm to implement both classically conditioned and instrumentally conditioned components. The role of the classically conditioned component is to develop an expectation of future benefit that is a function of the learning system's state and action. Competition among the instrumentally conditioned components determines the overt behavior generated by the learning system. Our model displays, in simulation, the reduced latency of the avoidance behavior during learning with continuing trials and the resistance to extinction of the avoidance response. These results are consistent with experimentally observed animal behavior. Our model extends the traditional two-process learning mechanism of Mowrer (1947) by explicitly defining the mechanisms of proprioceptive feedback, an internal clock, and generalization over the action space</title><text>We present a computational model of learned avoidance behavior in a one-way</text><keywords>computational model;learned avoidance behavior;one-way avoidance experiment;reinforcement learning;temporal-difference algorithm;classically conditioned components;instrumentally conditioned components;reduced latency;animal behavior;traditional two-process learning mechanism;proprioceptive feedback;internal clock</keywords></doc>

A solution to improve this hit rate is to have a group of proxies form co-operation where objects can be cached for later retrieval. A cooperative cache system includes protocols for hierarchical and transversal caching. The drawback of such a system lies in the resulting network load due to the number of messages that need to be exchanged to locate an object. This paper proposes a new co-operative Web caching architecture, which unifies previous methods of Web caching. Performance results shows that the architecture achieve up to 70% co-operative hit rate and accesses the cached object in at most two hops. Moreover, the architecture is scalable with low traffic and database overhead</title><text>Network caching of objects has become a standard way of reducing network</text><keywords>co-operative Web caching architecture;network caching;co-operative hit rate;cooperative cache system;protocols;transversal caching;network load</keywords></doc>

Satisficing game theory is based upon a well-defined notion of being good enough, and does accommodate group as well as individual interests through the use of conditional preference relationships, whereby a decision maker is able to adjust its preferences as a function of the preferences, and not just the options, of others.

We analytically construct the principal component analysis for images of a convex Lambertian object, explicitly taking attached shadows into account, and find the principal eigenmodes and eigenvalues with respect to lighting variability. Our analysis makes use of an analytic formula for the irradiance in terms of spherical-harmonic coefficients of the illumination and shows, under appropriate assumptions, that the principal components or eigenvectors are identical to the spherical harmonic basis functions evaluated at the surface normal vectors. Our main contribution is in extending these results to the single-viewpoint case, showing how the principal eigenmodes and eigenvalues are affected when only a limited subset (the upper hemisphere) of normals is available and the spherical harmonics are no longer orthonormal over the restricted domain.

One of the approaches to induce such a good decision tree is to add new attributes and their values to enhance the expressiveness of the training data at the data pre-processing stage. There are many existing methods for attribute extraction and construction, but constructing new attributes is still an art. These methods are very time consuming, and some of them need a priori knowledge of the data domain. They are not suitable for data mining dealing with large volumes of data. We propose a novel approach that the knowledge on attributes relevant to the class is extracted as association rules from the training data. The new attributes and the values are generated from the association rules among the originally given attributes. We elaborate on the method and investigate its feature.

If a reasonable amount of data is available, the ANN can "understand" the problem and provide the genetic algorithm with a selected population of elements that will speed up the search for the optimum solution. We tested the method in a search for the ground-state geometry of silicon clusters. We trained the ANN with information about the geometry and energetics of small silicon clusters. Next, the ANN learned how to restrict the configurational space for larger silicon clusters. For Si/sub 10/ and Si/sub 20/, we noticed that the NAGA is at least three times faster than the "pure" genetic algorithm.

<doc><title>An approximation to the F distribution using the chi-square distribution k, n), with associated degrees of freedom, k and n, a shrinking factor approximation (SFA), G( lambda kx; k), is proposed for large n and any fixed k, where G(x; k) is the chi-square c.d.f. with degrees of freedom, k, and lambda = lambda (kx; n) is the shrinking factor. Numerical analysis indicates that for n/k >or= 3, approximation accuracy of the SFA is to the fourth decimal place for most small values of k. This is a substantial improvement on the accuracy that is achievable using the normal, ordinary chi-square, and Scheffe-Tukey approximations. In addition, it is shown that the theoretical approximation error of the SFA, |F(x; k,n)-G( lambda kx; k)|, is O(1/n/sup 2/) uniformly over x</title><text>For the cumulative distribution function (c.d.f.) of the F distribution, F(x;</text><keywords>F distribution;cumulative distribution function;degrees of freedom;shrinking factor approximation;chi-square distribution;numerical analysis</keywords></doc>
<doc><title>A meteorological fuzzy expert system incorporating subjective user input the Mediterranean basin. The most successful local wind forecasting in this region is achieved by an expert human forecaster with access to numerical weather prediction products. That forecaster's knowledge is expressed as a set of 'rules-of-thumb'. Fuzzy set methodologies have proved well suited for encoding the forecaster's knowledge, and for accommodating the uncertainty inherent in the specification of rules, as well as in subjective and objective input. MEDEX uses fuzzy set theory in two ways: as a fuzzy rule base in the expert system, and for fuzzy pattern matching to select dominant wind circulation patterns as one input to the expert system. The system was developed, tuned, and verified over a two-year period, during which the weather conditions from 539 days were individually analyzed. Evaluations of MEDEX performance for both the onset and cessation of winter and summer winds are presented, and demonstrate that MEDEX has forecasting skill competitive with the US Navy's regional forecasting center in Rota, Spain</title><text>We present a fuzzy expert system, MEDEX, for forecasting gale-force winds in</text><keywords>meteorological fuzzy expert system;subjective user input;MEDEX;Mediterranean basin;numerical weather prediction products;fuzzy set theory;uncertainty;fuzzy rule base;fuzzy pattern matching;wind circulation patterns</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>A Virtual Test Facility for the simulation of dynamic response in materials Institute of Technology is constructing a virtual shock physics facility for studying the response of various target materials to very strong shocks. The Virtual Test Facility (VTF) is an end-to-end, fully three-dimensional simulation of the detonation of high explosives (HE), shock wave propagation, solid material response to pressure loading, and compressible turbulence. The VTF largely consists of a parallel fluid solver and a parallel solid mechanics package that are coupled together by the exchange of boundary data. The Eulerian fluid code and Lagrangian solid mechanics model interact via a novel approach based on level sets. The two main computational packages are integrated through the use of Pyre, a problem solving environment written in the Python scripting language. Pyre allows application developers to interchange various computational models and solver packages without recompiling code, and it provides standardized access to several data visualization engines and data input mechanisms. In this paper, we outline the main components of the VTF, discuss their integration via Pyre, and describe some recent accomplishments in large-scale simulation using the VTF</title><text>The Center for Simulating Dynamic Response of Materials at the California</text><keywords>virtual shock physics facility;Virtual Test Facility;high explosives;shock wave propagation;solid material response;pressure loading;compressible turbulence;parallel fluid solver;parallel solid mechanics;data visualization;Pyre;problem solving environment;Python scripting language</keywords></doc>

This formulation is made to couple certain piezoelectric constants to a transverse electric field to develop extension-bending actuation and shear-induced actuation. As an illustration, we present a sandwich model of three sublaminates: face/core/face. We develop a control scheme based on the linear quadratic regulator/independent modal space control (LQR/IMSC) method and use this to estimate the active stiffness and the active damping introduced by shear and extension-bending actuators. To assess the performance of each type of actuator, a dynamic response study is carried out in the modal domain.

<doc><title>A conflict between language and atomistic information theses in contemporary philosophy of mind: the thesis of Information-Based Semantics (IBS), the thesis of Content Atomism (Atomism) and the thesis of the Language of Thought (LOT). LOT concerns the semantically relevant structure of representations involved in cognitive states such as beliefs and desires. It maintains that all such representations must have syntactic structures mirroring the structure of their contents. IBS is a thesis about the nature of the relations that connect cognitive representations and their parts to their contents (semantic relations). It holds that these relations supervene solely on relations of the kind that support information content, perhaps with some help from logical principles of combination. Atomism is a thesis about the nature of the content of simple symbols. It holds that each substantive simple symbol possesses its content independently of all other symbols in the representational system.

PDL uses only parallel-connected transistors for fast logic evaluation and is a good candidate for high-speed low-voltage operation. It has less back-bias effect compared to other logic styles, which use stacked transistors. Furthermore, PDL needs no signal ordering or tapering. PDL with speed-enhanced skewed static logic renders straightforward logic synthesis without the usual area penalty due to logic duplication. Our experimental results on two 32-bit carry lookahead adders using 0.25- mu m CMOS technology show that PDL with speed-enhanced skewed static (SSS) look reduces the delay over clock-delayed(CD)-domino by 15%-27% and the power-delay product by 20%-37%</title><text>In this paper, we describe parallel dynamic logic (PDL) which exhibits high</text><keywords>high-speed CMOS circuits;parallel dynamic logic;speed-enhanced skewed static logic;parallel-connected transistors;low-voltage operation;logic synthesis;carry lookahead adders;delay;power-delay product;back-bias effect;stacked transistors</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>Advanced optimization strategies in the Rice dHPF compiler legacy Fortran codes to achieve scalable parallel performance. To a large extent, today's commercially available HPF compilers have failed to deliver scalable parallel performance for a broad spectrum of applications because of insufficiently powerful compiler analysis and optimization. Substantial restructuring and hand-optimization can be required to achieve acceptable performance with an HPF port of an existing Fortran application, even for regular data-parallel applications. A key goal of the Rice dHPF compiler project has been to develop optimization techniques that enable a wide range of existing scientific applications to be ported easily to efficient HPF with minimal restructuring. This paper describes the challenges to effective parallelization presented by complex (but regular) data-parallel applications, and then describes how the novel analysis and optimization technologies in the dHPF compiler address these challenges effectively, without major rewriting of the applications. We illustrate the techniques by describing their use for parallelizing the NAS SP and BT benchmarks. The dHPF compiler generates multipartitioned parallelizations of these codes that are approaching the scalability and efficiency of sophisticated hand-coded parallelizations</title><text>High-Performance Fortran (HPF) was envisioned as a vehicle for modernizing</text><keywords>legacy Fortran codes;parallel performance;HPF compilers;compiler analysis;Rice dHPF compiler</keywords></doc>
<doc><title>Tools for the analysis of dose optimization. I. Effect-volume histogram intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), computer software has progressed beyond the point of being merely a tool at the hands of an expert and has become an active, independent mediator of the dosimetric conflicts between treatment goals and risks. To understand and control the internal decision finding as well as to provide means to influence it, a tool for the analysis of the dose distribution is presented which reveals the decision-making process performed by the algorithm. The internal trade-offs between partial volumes receiving high or low doses are driven by functions which attribute a weight to each volume element. The statistics of the distribution of these weights is cast into an effect-volume histogram (EVH) in analogy to dose-volume histograms. The analysis of the EVH reveals which traits of the optimum dose distribution result from the defined objectives, and which are a random consequence of under- or misspecification of treatment goals. The EVH can further assist in the process of finding suitable objectives and balancing conflicting objectives. If biologically inspired objectives are used, the EVH shows the distribution of local dose effect relative to the prescribed level</title><text>With the advent of dose optimization algorithms, predominantly for</text><keywords>dose optimization algorithms;effect-volume histogram;intensity-modulated radiotherapy;dosimetric conflicts;treatment goals;computer software;decision-making process;partial volumes;low doses</keywords></doc>

This goal is pursued by adopting linear-in-the-parameters NARX models, for which an identification method is developed based on the minimization of the simulation error. This method is capable of selecting the model structure together with the parameters, thus it does not require a priori structural information.

<doc><title>A new architecture for implementing pipelined FIR ADF based on classification of coefficients finite-impulse response (FIR) adaptive digital filter (ADF), with an aim of reducing the maximum delay of the filtering portion of conventional delayed least mean square (DLMS) pipelined ADF. We achieve a filtering section with a maximum delay of one by simplifying a pre-upsampled and a post-downsampled FIR filter using the concept of classification of coefficients. This reduction is independent of the order of the filter, which is an advantage when the order of the filter is very large, and as a result the method can also be applied to infinite impulse response (IIR) filters. Furthermore, when the proposed method is compared with the transpose ADF, which has a filtering section with zero delay, it is realized that it significantly reduces the maximum delay associated with updating the coefficients of FIR ADF. The effect of this is that, the proposed method exhibits a higher convergence speed in comparison to the transpose FIR ADF</title><text>In this paper, we propose a new method for implementing pipelined</text><keywords>pipelined FIR ADF;adaptive digital filter;maximum delay;convergence speed</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>Adaptive wavelet methods. II. Beyond the elliptic case methods for systems of operator equations. Its main accomplishment is to extend the range of applicability of the adaptive wavelet-based method developed previously for symmetric positive definite problems to indefinite or unsymmetric systems of operator equations. This is accomplished by first introducing techniques (such as the least squares formulation developed previously) that transform the original (continuous) problem into an equivalent infinite system of equations which is now well-posed in the Euclidean metric. It is then shown how to utilize adaptive techniques to solve the resulting infinite system of equations. It is shown that for a wide range of problems, this new adaptive method performs with asymptotically optimal complexity, i.e., it recovers an approximate solution with desired accuracy at a computational expense that stays proportional to the number of terms in a corresponding wavelet-best N-term approximation. An important advantage of this adaptive approach is that it automatically stabilizes the numerical procedure so that, for instance, compatibility constraints on the choice of trial spaces, like the LBB condition, no longer arise</title><text>This paper is concerned with the design and analysis of adaptive wavelet</text><keywords>adaptive wavelet methods;elliptic case;operator equations;least squares formulation;Euclidean metric;asymptotically optimal complexity;N-term approximation</keywords></doc>
<doc><title>Design and implementation of a reusable and extensible HL7 encoding/decoding framework exchange in all health care environments, enables disparate computer applications to exchange key sets of clinical and administrative information. Above all, it defines the standard HL7 message formats prescribed by the standard encoding rules. In this paper, we propose a flexible, reusable, and extensible HL7 encoding and decoding framework using a message object model (MOM) and message definition repository (MDR). The MOM provides an abstract HL7 message form represented by a group of objects and their relationships. It reflects logical relationships among the standard HL7 message elements such as segments, fields, and components, while enforcing the key structural constraints imposed by the standard. Since the MOM completely eliminates the dependency of the HL7 encoder and decoder on platform-specific data formats, it makes it possible to build the encoder and decoder as reusable standalone software components, enabling the interconnection of arbitrary heterogeneous hospital information systems (HIS) with little effort. Moreover, the MDR, an external database of key definitions for HL7 messages, helps make the encoder and decoder as resilient as possible to future modifications of the standard HL7 message formats. It is also used by the encoder and decoder to perform a well-formedness check for their respective inputs (i.e., HL7 message objects expressed in the MOM and encoded HL7 message strings). Although we implemented a prototype version of the encoder and decoder using JAVA, they can be easily packaged and delivered as standalone components using the standard component frameworks</title><text>The Health Level Seven (HL7), an international standard for electronic data</text><keywords>Health Level Seven;message object model;message definition repository;MDR;MOM;logical relationships;structural constraints;international standard;standalone software components;heterogeneous hospital information systems;HIS;external database;key definitions;JAVA;health care environments;administrative information;HL7 message formats</keywords></doc>

The present study compares the use of 17 different technologies in similar industries in the USA (n=1025) and UK (n=166) using a common questionnaire. Largely, there are remarkable similarities between the two countries. This may partly correlate with the heavy traffic in foreign direct investment between the two nations. Notable differences are (1) across-the-board, US manufacturers are ahead of the UK firms in computerized integration with units inside and outside manufacturing organizations; (2) US manufacturers show higher labour productivity, which is consistent with macro-economic data, and (3) more UK manufacturers report the use of soft technologies such as just-in-time, total quality manufacturing and manufacturing cells.

<doc><title>Hardware and software platform for real-time processing and visualization of echographic radiofrequency signals ultrasonic investigation is presented. The platform, used in conjunction with an analog front-end hardware for driving the ultrasonic transducers of any commercial echograph, having the radiofrequency echo signal access, make it possible to dispose of a powerful echographic system for experimenting any processing technique, also in a clinical environment in which real-time operation mode is an essential prerequisite. The platform transforms any echograph into a test-system for evaluating the diagnostic effectiveness of new investigation techniques. A particular user interface was designed in order to allow a real-time and simultaneous visualization of the results produced in the different stages of the chosen processing procedure. This is aimed at obtaining a better optimization of the processing algorithm. The most important platform aspect, which also constitutes the basic differentiation with respect to similar systems, is the direct processing of the radiofrequency echo signal, which is essential for a complete analysis of the particular ultrasound-media interaction phenomenon. The platform completely integrates the architecture of a personal computer (PC) giving rise to several benefits, such as the quick technological evolution in the PC field and an extreme degree of programmability for different applications. The PC also constitutes the user interface, as a flexible and intuitive visualization support, and performs some software signal processing, by custom algorithms and commercial libraries. The realized close synergy between hardware and software allows the acquisition and real-time processing of the echographic radiofrequency (RF) signal with fast data representation</title><text>In this paper the architecture of a hardware and software platform, for</text><keywords>echographic radiofrequency signal;real-time processing;software platform;user interface;personal computer</keywords></doc>

First, each coefficient of the variable allpass filter is expressed as the polynomial of the fractional delay parameter. Then, the nonlinear phase error is approximated by a weighted equation error such that the cost function can be converted into a quadratic form. Next, by minimizing the weighted equation error, the optimal polynomial coefficients can be obtained iteratively by solving a set of linear simultaneous equations at each iteration.

<doc><title>The changing landscape for multi access portals operators in recent years causing them, like others in the telecommunications, media and technology sector, to take a close look at their business models following the dot.com crash and the consequent reassessment of Internet-related project financing by the venture capital community. While the pressure is on to generate income from existing customers and users, portal operators must reach new markets and find realistic revenue streams. This search for real revenues has led to a move towards charging for content, a strategy being pursued by a large number of horizontal portal players, including MSN and Terra Lycos. This trend is particularly noticeable in China, where Chinadotcom operates a mainland portal and plans a range of fee-based services, including electronic mail. The nature of advertising itself is changing, with portals seeking blue-chip sponsorship and marketing deals that span a number of years. Players are struggling to redefine and reinvent themselves as a result of the changing environment and even the term "portal" is believed to be obsolete, partly due to its dot.com crash associations.

<doc><title>On generalized Gaussian quadratures for exponentials and their applications of exponential functions and consider their applications to integration and interpolation of bandlimited functions. We use a generalization of a representation theorem due to Caratheodory to derive these quadratures. For each positive measure, the quadratures are parameterized by eigenvalues of the Toeplitz matrix constructed from the trigonometric moments of the measure. For a given accuracy epsilon , selecting an eigenvalue close to epsilon yields an approximate quadrature with that accuracy. To compute its weights and nodes, we present a new fast algorithm. These new quadratures can be used to approximate and integrate bandlimited functions, such as prolate spheroidal wave functions, and essentially bandlimited functions, such as Bessel functions. We also develop, for a given precision, an interpolating basis for bandlimited functions on an interval</title><text>We introduce new families of Gaussian-type quadratures for weighted integrals</text><keywords>generalized Gaussian quadratures;weighted integrals;exponential functions;integration;interpolation;bandlimited functions;eigenvalues;Toeplitz matrix;trigonometric moments;prolate spheroidal wave functions;Bessel functions</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>Vibration control of structure by using tuned mass damper (development of system which suppress displacement of auxiliary mass) (ATMD), stroke of the auxiliary mass is so limited that it is difficult to control the vibration in the case of large disturbance input. In this paper, two methods are proposed for the problem. One of the methods is a switching control system by two types of controllers. One of the controllers is a normal controller under small relative displacement of the auxiliary mass, and the other is not effective only for first mode of vibration under large relative displacement of the auxiliary mass. New variable gain control system is constructed by switching these two controllers. The other method is the brake system. In active vibration control, it is necessary to use actuator for active control. By using the actuator, the proposed system puts on the brake to suppress displacement increase of the auxiliary mass under large disturbance input. Finally, the systems are designed and the effectiveness of the systems is confirmed by the simulation</title><text>In vibration control of a structure by using an active tuned mass damper</text><keywords>tuned mass damper;vibration control;variable gain control system;brake system;actuator;active control;controllers</keywords></doc>

The evolutionary technique is applied to building dominant structural identification with local parametric tuning without the need of a differentiable performance index in the presence of noisy data. It is shown that the evolutionary technique provides an excellent fitting performance and is capable of accommodating multiple objectives such as to examine the relationships between model complexity and fitting accuracy during the model building process. Validation results show that the proposed method offers robust, uncluttered and accurate models for two practical systems. It is expected that this type of grey-box models will accommodate many practical engineering systems for a better modelling accuracy</title><text>This paper presents an evolutionary grey-box model identification methodology</text><keywords>grey-box models</keywords></doc>
<doc><title>Real-time estimations of multi-modal frequencies for smart structures frequencies are realized in real time and compared through numerical and experimental tests. These parameter-based frequency estimation methods can be applied to various engineering fields such as communications, radar and adaptive vibration and noise control. Well-known frequency estimation methods are introduced and explained. The Bairstow method is introduced to find the roots of a characteristic equation for estimations of multi-modal frequencies, and the computational efficiency of the Bairstow method is shown quantitatively. For a simple numerical test, we consider two sinusoids of the same amplitudes mixed with various amounts of white noise. The test results show that the auto regressive (AR) and auto regressive and moving average (ARMA) methods are unsuitable in noisy environments. The other methods apart from the AR method have fast tracking capability. From the point of view of computational efficiency, the results reveal that the ARMA method is inefficient, while the cascade notch filter method is very effective. The linearized adaptive notch filter and recursive maximum likelihood methods have average performances. Experimental tests are devised to confirm the feasibility of real-time computations and to impose the severe conditions of drastically different amplitudes and of considerable changes of natural frequencies. We have performed experiments to extract the natural frequencies from the vibration signal of wing-like composite plates in real time. The natural frequencies of the specimen are changed by added masses. Especially, the AR method exhibits a remarkable performance in spite of the severe conditions. This study will be helpful to anyone who needs a frequency estimation algorithm for real-time applications</title><text>In this paper, various methods for the real-time estimation of multi-modal</text><keywords>multi-modal frequencies;smart structures;real-time estimation;frequency estimation;noise control;Bairstow method;characteristic equation;ARMA;cascade notch filter;linearized adaptive notch filter;recursive maximum likelihood methods;real-time computations;vibration signal;wing-like composite plates;frequency estimation algorithm;real-time applications</keywords></doc>

To construct suffix trees for integer alphabets in linear time had been a major open problem on index data structures. Farach used this approach and gave the first linear-time algorithm for integer alphabets. The hardest part of Farach's algorithm is the merging step.

To this aim we propose to eliminate the need to solve optimization problems at successive iterations of interactive decision processes. We show that the need for optimization can be eliminated by the ability of establishing sufficiently tight bounds on criteria values for efficient decisions prior to explicit identification of such decisions. We present a technique, fully operational and numerically simple, for establishing such bounds. Bounds are dynamic, i.e., they become stronger with the growing number of decisions explicitly identified. They are also parametric with respect to weighting coefficients. We also point out how this technique can enhance the existing interactive decision making methods</title><text>We present a development intended to make interactive decision making schemes</text><keywords>multiple criteria decision making;interactive decision making schemes;decision makers;efficient decisions</keywords></doc>
<doc><title>Angular disparity in ETACT scintimammography to have the potential for the detection of small tumors (<1 cm) in scintimammography. However, the optimal approach to the application of ETACT in the clinic has yet to be determined. Therefore, we sought to determine the effect of the angular disparity between the ETACT projections on image quality through the use of a computer simulation. A small, spherical tumor of variable size (5, 7.5 or 10 mm) was placed at the center of a hemispherical breast (15 cm diameter). The tumor to nontumor ratio was either 5:1 or 10:1. The detector was modeled to be a gamma camera fitted with a 4-mm-diam pinhole collimator. The pinhole-to-detector and the pinhole-to-tumor distances were 25 and 15 cm, respectively. A ray tracing technique was used to generate three sets of projections (10 degrees , 15 degrees , and 20 degrees , angular disparity). These data were blurred to a resolution consistent with the 4 mm pinhole. The TACT reconstruction method was used to reconstruct these three image sets. The tumor contrast and the axial spatial resolution was measured. Smaller angular disparity led to an improvement in image contrast but at a cost of degraded axial spatial resolution. The improvement in contrast is due to a slight improvement in the in-plane spatial resolution. Since improved contrast should lead to better tumor detectability, smaller angular disparity should be used. However, the difference in contrast between 10 degrees and 15 degrees was very slight and therefore a reasonable clinical choice for angular disparity is 15 degrees</title><text>Emission tuned aperture computed tomography (ETACT) has been previously shown</text><keywords>angular disparity;small tumors;image quality;computer simulation;spherical tumor;hemispherical breast;gamma camera;pinhole collimator;pinhole-to-tumor distances;ray tracing technique;image sets;axial spatial resolution;in-plane spatial resolution;clinical choice</keywords></doc>

Species concentrations in both phases are modified by chemical reactions and by this phase transfer. The model equations resulting from such multiphase chemical systems are nonlinear, highly coupled and extremely stiff. In the paper we investigate several numerical approaches for treating such processes. The droplets are subdivided into several classes. This decomposition of the droplet spectrum into classes is based on their droplet size and the amount of scavenged material inside the drops, respectively. The very fast dissociations in the aqueous phase chemistry are treated as forward and backward reactions. The aqueous phase and gas phase chemistry, the mass transfer between the different droplet classes among themselves and with the gas phase are integrated in an implicit and coupled manner by the second order BDF method. For this part we apply a modification of the code LSODE with special linear system solvers. These direct sparse techniques exploit the special block structure of the corresponding Jacobian. Furthermore we investigate an approximate matrix factorization which is related to operator splitting at the linear algebra level. The sparse Jacobians are generated explicitly and stored in a sparse form. The efficiency and accuracy of our time-integration schemes is discussed for four multiphase chemistry systems of different complexity and for a different number of droplet classes</title><text>The existence of cloud drops leads to a transfer of chemical species between</text><keywords>multiphase chemistry;size-resolved cloud models;cloud drops;chemical species;chemical reactions;multiphase chemical systems;aqueous phase chemistry;gas phase chemistry;approximate matrix factorization;operator splitting;linear algebra;sparse Jacobians;time-integration schemes</keywords></doc>

The goal is to assign as few wavelengths as possible, in order to use the optical bandwidth efficiently. If a node of a network contains a wavelength converter, any path that passes through this node may change its wavelength. Having converters at some of the nodes can reduce the number of wavelengths required for routing. This paper presents a wavelength converter with degree 4 and gives a routing algorithm which shows that any routing with load L can be realized with L wavelengths when a node of an all-optical ring hosts such a wavelength converter.

Feynman hesitated about the possibility of imitating fermion systems using such a device. Here we address some of his concerns and, in particular, investigate the simulation of fermionic systems.

This new microinjector uses asymmetric bubbles to reduce crosstalk, increase frequency response and eliminate satellite droplets. During a firing, i.e., droplet ejection, the "virtual valve" closes, by growing a thermal bubble in the microchannel, to isolate the microchamber from the liquid supply and neighboring chambers. Between firings, however, the virtual valve opens, by collapsing the bubble, to reduce flow restriction for fast refilling of the microchamber. The use of bubble valves brings about fast and reliable device operation without imposing the significant complication fabrication of physical microvalves would call for. In addition, through a special heater configuration and chamber designs, bubbles surrounding the nozzle cut off the tail of the droplets being ejected and completely eliminate satellite droplets.

<doc><title>Pareto-optimal formulations for cost versus colorimetric accuracy trade-offs in printer color management primarily to nonlinear ink-mixing behavior and the presence of redundant solutions for print devices with more than three inks. Algorithms for the conversion of image data to printer-specific format are typically designed to achieve a single predetermined rendering intent, such as colorimetric accuracy. We present two CIELAB to CMYK color conversion schemes based on a general Pareto-optimal formulation for printer color management. The schemes operate using a 149-color characterization data set selected to efficiently capture the entire CMYK gamut. The first scheme uses artificial neural networks as transfer functions between the CIELAB and CMYK spaces. The second scheme is based on a reformulation of tetrahedral interpolation as an optimization problem. Characterization data are divided into tetrahedra for the interpolation-based approach using the program Qhull, which removes the common restriction that characterization data be well organized. Both schemes offer user control over trade-off problems such as cost versus reproduction accuracy, allowing for user-specified print objectives and the use of constraints such as maximum allowable ink and maximum allowable AE*/sub ab/. A formulation for minimization of ink is shown to be particularly favorable, integrating both a clipping and gamut compression features into a single methodology</title><text>Color management for the printing of digital images is a challenging task, due</text><keywords>printer color management;nonlinear ink-mixing behavior;redundant solutions;Pareto-optimal formulations;cost versus colorimetric accuracy trade-offs;CIELAB to CMYK color conversion schemes;artificial neural networks;transfer functions;tetrahedral interpolation;optimization;tetrahedra;interpolation-based approach;user control;cost versus reproduction accuracy;user-specified print objectives;maximum allowable ink;constraints;gamut compression features;clipping;rendering intent</keywords></doc>
<doc><title>A strategy for a payoff-switching differential game based on fuzzy reasoning introduced. In this new game, any one player at any time may have several choices of payoffs for the future. Moreover, the payoff-switching process, including the time of payoff switching and the outcome payoff, of any one player is unknown to the other. Indeed, the overall payoff, which is a sequence of several payoffs, is unknown until the game ends. An algorithm for determining a reasoning strategy based on fuzzy reasoning is proposed. In this algorithm, the fuzzy theory is used to estimate the behavior of one player during a past time interval. By deriving two fuzzy matrices GSM, game similarity matrix, and VGSM, variation of GSM, the behavior of the player can be quantified. Two weighting vectors are selected to weight the relative importance of the player's behavior at each past time instant. Finally a simple fuzzy inference rule is adopted to generate a linear reasoning strategy. The advantage of this algorithm is that it provides a flexible way for differential game specialists to convert their knowledge into a "reasonable" strategy. A practical example of guarding three territories is given to illustrate our main ideas</title><text>In this paper, a new concept of a payoff-switching differential game is</text><keywords>payoff-switching differential game;payoff switching;outcome payoff;reasoning strategy;fuzzy reasoning;fuzzy matrices;game similarity matrix;weighting vectors;fuzzy inference;differential game</keywords></doc>

In this paper, we present a robust constrained output feedback MPC algorithm that can stabilize plants with both polytopic uncertainty and norm-bound uncertainty. The design procedure involves off-line design of a robust constrained state feedback MPC law and a state estimator using linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Since we employ an off-line approach for the controller design which gives a sequence of explicit control laws, we are able to analyze the robust stabilizability of the combined control laws and estimator, and by adjusting the design parameters, guarantee robust stability of the closed-loop system in the presence of constraints. The algorithm is illustrated with two examples</title><text>A fundamental question about model predictive control (MPC) is its robustness</text><keywords>robust output feedback model predictive control;off-line linear matrix inequalities;robust constrained output feedback MPC algorithm;polytopic uncertainty;norm-bound uncertainty;robust constrained state feedback MPC law;state estimator;closed-loop system</keywords></doc>

We further show that these decompositions are stability and FIR preserving.

Under different cutting conditions, cutting and indenting-cutting tests are carried out by single point cutting tools and single diamond segments. The results indicate that the depth of cut per diamond grit increases as the blades move forward. Only a few grits per segment can remove the material in the cutting process. When the direction of the stroke changes, the cutting forces do not decrease to zero because of the residual plastic deformation beneath the diamond grits. The plastic deformation and fracture chipping of material are the dominant removal processes, which can be explained by the fracture theory of brittle material indentation</title><text>An investigation has been undertaken into the frame sawing with diamond blades.</text><keywords>marble cutting;single point cutting tool;diamond segments;frame sawing;kinematic behaviour;indenting-cutting tests;residual plastic deformation;fracture chipping;removal processes;fracture theory;brittle material indentation</keywords></doc>

When a rule needed for solving the problem does not exist, the problem can be solved by using rules similar to the existing rules. In an implementation using the SLD procedure, a resolution is executed between a subgoal and a rule if an atom of the subgoal is similar to the consequence atom of the rule. Similarities between atoms are calculated using a knowledge base of words with account of the reasoning situation, and the reliability of the derived solution is calculated based on these similarities. If many solutions are obtained, they are grouped into classes of similar solutions and a representative solution is then selected for each class.

<doc><title>Evolving receptive-field controllers for mobile robots autonomous agents has attracted attention. Most of the pertinent research has employed genetic algorithms or variations thereof. Research has applied an alternative evolutionary method, evolution strategies, to the generation of simple Braitenberg vehicles. This application accelerates the development of such controllers by more than an order of magnitude (a few hours compared to more than two days). Motivated by this useful speedup, the paper investigates the evolution of more complex architectures, receptive-field controllers, that can employ nonlinear interactions and, therefore, can yield more complex behavior. It is interesting to note that the evolution strategy yields the same efficacy in terms of function evaluations, even though the second class of controllers requires up to 10 times more parameters than the simple Braitenberg architecture. In addition to the speedup, there is an important theoretical reason for preferring an evolution strategy over a genetic algorithm for this problem, namely the presence of epistasis</title><text>The use of evolutionary methods to generate controllers for real-world</text><keywords>receptive-field controllers;mobile robots;evolutionary methods;evolution strategies;simple Braitenberg vehicles;nonlinear interactions;complex behavior</keywords></doc>

Given a set of 2D free-form bins and a set of 2D free-form items, the 2D-FBP problem is to lay out items inside one or more bins in such a way that the number of bins used is minimized, and for each bin, the yield is maximized. The proposed algorithm handles the problem as a variant of the 1D problem; i.e., items and bins are approximated as sets of scanlines, and scanlines are packed. The details of the algorithm are given, and its application to a nesting problem in a shipbuilding company is reported. The proposed algorithm consists of the basic and the group placement algorithms. The basic placement algorithm is a variant of the first-fit decreasing algorithm which is simply extended from the 1D case to the 2D case by a novel scanline approximation. A numerical study with real instances shows that the basic placement algorithm has sufficient performance for most of the instances, however, the group placement algorithm is required when items must be aligned in columns. The qualities of the resulting layouts are good enough for practical use, and the processing times are good</title><text>This paper describes a heuristic algorithm for the 2D free-form bin packing</text><keywords>scanline-based algorithm;2D free-form bin packing problem;heuristic algorithm;2D-FBP problem;nesting problem;shipbuilding company;group placement algorithm;first-fit decreasing algorithm</keywords></doc>
<doc><title>Optimization of requantization parameter for MPEG transcoding low-bit-rate MPEG stream, and proposes a method in which the transcoding error can be reduced by optimally selecting the quantization parameter for each macroblock. In transcoding with a low compression ratio, it is crucial to prohibit transcoding with a requantization parameter which is 1 to 2 times the quantization parameter of the input stream. Consequently, as the first step, an optimization method for the requantization parameter is proposed which cares for the error propagation effect by interframe prediction. Then, the proposed optimization method is extended so that the method can also be applied to the case of a high compression ratio in which the rate-distortion curve is approximated for each macroblock in the range of requantization parameters larger than 2 times the quantization parameter. It is verified by a simulation experiment that the PSNR is improved by 0.5 to 0.8 dB compared to the case in which a 6 Mbit/s MPEG stream is not optimized by twofold recompression</title><text>This paper considers transcoding in which an MPEG stream is converted to a</text><keywords>low-bit-rate MPEG stream;transcoding error;macroblock;compression ratio;error propagation effect;interframe prediction;rate-distortion curve;PSNR;simulation;twofold recompression</keywords></doc>

The goal of the current study is developing hypothetical reasoning based on an inference path network, which would overcome this drawback. In hypothetical reasoning systems based on an inference path network, there is much room for improvement regarding the computing costs of connotation processing and consistency checking. The authors of this study demonstrate improvement ideas regarding one of these problems, namely, consistency checking. First, the authors obtained necessary and sufficient conditions under which inconsistencies occur during hypothesis composition. Based on the obtained results, the authors proposed an algorithm for speeding up the process of consistency checking. Processing with this algorithm in its core consists of transforming the inference path network in such a way that inconsistencies do not occur during the hypothesis composition, under the condition of unchanged solution hypotheses.

<doc><title>Succession in standardization: grafting XML onto SGML improvements must be weighed against those of compatibility. If compatibility considerations dominate, a grafting process takes place. According to our taxonomy of succession, there are three types of outcomes. A Type I succession, where grafting is successful, entails compatibility between successors, technical paradigm compliance and continuity in the standards trajectory. In this paper, we examine issues of succession and focus on the Extensible Markup Language (XML). It was to be grafted on the Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), a stable standard since 1988. However, XML was a profile, a subset and an extension of SGML (1988). Adaptation of SGML was needed (SGML 1999) to forge full (downward) compatibility with XML (1998). We describe the grafting efforts and analyze their outcomes. Our conclusion is that although SGML was a technical exemplar for XML developers, full compatibility was not achieved. The widespread use of HyperText Mark-up Language (HTML) exemplified the desirability of simplicity in XML, standardization. This and HTML's user market largely explain the discontinuity in SGML-XML succession</title><text>Succession in standardization is often a problem.

<doc><title>Time-resolved contrast-enhanced imaging with isotropic resolution and broad coverage using an undersampled 3D projection trajectory popularity but are still limited by the tradeoff between spatial and temporal resolution. A method is presented that greatly reduces this tradeoff by employing undersampled 3D projection reconstruction trajectories. The variable density k-space sampling intrinsic to this sequence is combined with temporal k-space interpolation to provide time frames as short as 4 s. This time resolution reduces the need for exact contrast timing while also providing dynamic information. Spatial resolution is determined primarily by the projection readout resolution and is thus isotropic across the FOV, which is also isotropic. Although undersampling the outer regions of k-space introduces aliased energy into the image, which may compromise resolution, this is not a limiting factor in high-contrast applications such as MRA. Results from phantom and volunteer studies are presented demonstrating isotropic resolution, broad coverage with an isotropic field of view (FOV), minimal projection reconstruction artifacts, and temporal information.

The fitness score was derived by combining the scores of the training and test sets. The ability of the proposed algorithm to select relevant subsets of descriptors was tested on two data sets.

In the paper, a model of the GMAW process is developed using an exact arc voltage characteristic. This model is used to study stability of the self-regulation process and to develop a simulation program that helps to understand the transient or dynamic nature of the GMAW process and relationships among current, electrode extension and contact tube-work distance. The process is shown to exhibit instabilities at both long electrode extension and normal extension. Results obtained from simulation runs of the model were also experimentally confirmed by the present author, as reported in this study.

<doc><title>Access privilege management in protection systems associate one or more locks with each object, one lock for each access right defined by the object type. Possession of an access right on a given object is certified by possession of a key for this object, if this key matches one of the object locks. We introduce a number of variants to this basic key-lock technique. Polymorphic access rights make it possible to decrease the number of keys required to certify possession of complex access privileges that are defined in terms of several access rights. Multiple locks on the same access right allow us to exercise forms of selective revocation of access privileges. A lock conversion function can be used to reduce the number of locks associated with any given object to a single lock. The extent of the results obtained is evaluated in relation to alternative methodologies for access privilege management</title><text>We consider the problem of managing access privileges on protected objects.

<doc><title>Fast accurate MEG source localization using a multilayer perceptron trained with real brain noise use for source localization from electroencephalographic (EEG) and magnetoencephalographic (MEG) signals. Unfortunately, LM depends sensitively on the initial guess, necessitating repeated runs. This, combined with LM's high per-step cost, makes its computational burden quite high. To reduce this burden, we trained a multilayer perceptron (MLP) as a realtime localizer. We used an analytical model of quasistatic electromagnetic propagation through a spherical head to map randomly chosen dipoles to sensor activities according to the sensor geometry of a 4D Neuroimaging Neuromag-122 MEG system, and trained a MLP to invert this mapping in the absence of noise or in the presence of various sorts of noise such as white Gaussian noise, correlated noise, or real brain noise. A MLP structure was chosen to trade off computation and accuracy. This MLP was trained four times, with each type of noise. We measured the effects of initial guesses on LM performance, which motivated a hybrid MLP-start-LM method, in which the trained MLP initializes LM. We also compared the localization performance of LM, MLPs, and hybrid MLP-start-LMs for realistic brain signals. Trained MLPs are much faster than other methods, while the hybrid MLP-start-LMs are faster and more accurate than fixed-4-start-LM. In particular, the hybrid MLP-start-LM initialized by a MLP trained with the real brain noise dataset is 60 times faster and is comparable in accuracy to random-20-start-LM, and this hybrid system (localization error: 0.28 cm, computation time: 36 ms) shows almost as good performance as optimal-1-start-LM (localization error: 0.23 cm, computation time: 22 ms), which initializes LM with the correct dipole location. MLPs trained with noise perform better than the MLP trained without noise, and the MLP trained with real brain noise is almost as good an initial guesser for LM as the correct dipole location</title><text>Iterative gradient methods such as Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) are in widespread</text><keywords>MEG source localization;multilayer perceptron;real brain noise;analytical model;quasistatic electromagnetic propagation;spherical head;white Gaussian noise;correlated noise;iterative gradient methods</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>Three-dimensional spiral MR imaging: application to renal multiphase contrast-enhanced angiography partition encoding was developed for multiphase contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (CE-MRA) of the renal vasculature. Compared to a standard multiphase 3D CE-MRA with FLASH readout, an isotropic in-plane spatial resolution of 1.4*1.4 mm/sup 2/ over 2.0*1.4 mm/sup 2/ could be achieved with a temporal resolution of 6 sec. The theoretical gain of spatial resolution by using the spiral pulse sequence and the performance in the presence of turbulent flow was evaluated in phantom measurements. Multiphase 3D CE-MRA of the renal arteries was performed in five healthy volunteers using both techniques. A deblurring technique was used to correct the spiral raw data. Thereby, the off-resonance frequencies were determined by minimizing the imaginary part of the data in image space. The chosen correction algorithm was able to reduce image blurring substantially in all MRA phases. The image quality of the spiral CE-MRA pulse sequence was comparable to that of the FLASH CE-MRA with increased spatial resolution and a 25% reduced contrast-to-noise ratio. Additionally, artifacts specific to spiral MRI could be observed which had no impact on the assessment of the renal arteries</title><text>A fast MR pulse sequence with spiral in-plane readout and conventional 3D</text><keywords>renal multiphase contrast-enhanced angiography;deblurring;spiral in-plane readout;renal vasculature;off-resonance frequencies;image quality;reduced contrast-to-noise ratio;spatial resolution</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>LAN-based building maintenance and surveillance robot many developed countries around the world. After the commissioning of a high-rise building or a large estate, substantial manpower, both inside the management centre under a standby manner, as well as surveillance for security purposes around the whole building, is required for daily operation to ensure a quality environment for the occupants. If the surveillance job can be done by robots, the efficiency can be highly enhanced, resulting in a great saving of manpower and the improved safety of the management staff as a by-product. Furthermore, if the robot can retrieve commands from the building management system via a local area network (LAN), further savings in manpower can be achieved in terms of first-line fault attendance by human management staff. This paper describes the development of a robot prototype here in Hong Kong, which can handle some daily routine maintenance works and surveillance responsibilities. The hardware structure of the robot and its on-board devices are described. Real-time images captured by a camera on the robot with pan/tilt/zoom functions can be transmitted back to the central management office via a local area network. The interface between the robot and the building automation system (BAS) of the building is discussed. This is the first key achievement of this project with a strong implication on reducing the number of human staff to manage a modem building. Teleoperation of the robot via the Internet or intranet is also possible, which is the second achievement of this project. Finally, the robot can identify its physical position inside the building by a landmark recognition method based on standard CAD drawings, which is the third achievement of this project. The main goal of this paper is not the description of some groundbreaking technology in robotic development.

Understanding hydrogel properties is also important from the standpoint of their similarity to many biological tissues. Typically, gel size is sensitive to outer solution pH and salt concentration. In this paper, we develop models to predict the swelling/deswelling of hydrogels in buffered pH solutions. An equilibrium model has been developed to predict the degree of swelling of the hydrogel at a given pH and salt concentration in the solution. A kinetic model has been developed to predict the rate of swelling of the hydrogel when the solution pH is changed. Experiments are performed to characterize the mechanical properties of the hydrogel in different pH solutions. The degree of swelling as well as the rate of swelling of the hydrogel are also studied through experiments. The simulations are compared with experimental results and the models are found to predict the swelling/deswelling processes accurately</title><text>The widespread application of ionic hydrogels in a number of applications like</text><keywords>pH-responsive hydrogels;ionic hydrogels;microfluidic flow;muscle-like actuators;filtration/separation;drug delivery;gel size;swelling/deswelling;buffered pH solutions;equilibrium model;mechanical properties</keywords></doc>

An attempt is made to consider the elements of indexing, their pros and cons. The argument is made that machine indexing is far too prolific in its production of index terms.

The DSC, well known from two- and three-level inverters, is adapted to the D3LI and optimized for a minimum torque ripple. An 18-corner trajectory is chosen for the stator flux of the induction machine since it is approaching the ideal circle much better than the hexagon known from DSC for two-level inverters, without any detriment to the torque ripple.

In this paper, we focus on a single-period project which consists of two types of cash flows; an investment at one period and a return at a succeeding period, and a financing at one period and a repayment at a succeeding period. We decompose the given investment project into a series of the single-period projects. From the viewpoint of the single-period project, we point out the applicability issue of the IRR criterion, namely the IRR criterion cannot be applied in which a project is composed of both investment type and financing type. Investigating the properties of a series of the single-period projects, we resolve the applicability issue of the IRR criterion and propose the decision procedure for profitability judgment toward any type of investment project based on the comparison between the IRR and the capital cost. We develop a new algorithm to obtain the value of the project investment rate (PIR) for the given project, which is a function of the capital cost, only using the standard IRR computing routine. This outcome is a theoretical breakthrough to widen the utilization of IRR in practical applications</title><text>The internal rate of return (IRR) criterion is often used to evaluate</text><keywords>decision procedure;internal rate of return;single-period projects;profitability;cash flows;IRR criterion;project investment rate;PIR</keywords></doc>
<doc><title>Incorporating multi-leaf collimator leaf sequencing into iterative IMRT optimization considers beam optimization and beam delivery as separate tasks. Following optimization, a multi-leaf collimator (MLC) or other beam delivery device is used to generate fluence patterns for patient treatment delivery. Due to limitations and characteristics of the MLC, the deliverable intensity distributions often differ from those produced by the optimizer, leading to differences between the delivered and the optimized doses. Objective function parameters are then adjusted empirically, and the plan is reoptimized to achieve a desired deliverable dose distribution. The resulting plan, though usually acceptable, may not be the best achievable. A method has been developed to incorporate the MLC restrictions into the optimization process. Our in-house IMRT system has been modified to include the calculation of the deliverable intensity into the optimizer. In this process, prior to dose calculation, the MLC leaf sequencer is used to convert intensities to dynamic MLC sequences, from which the deliverable intensities are then determined. All other optimization steps remain the same. To evaluate the effectiveness of deliverable-based optimization, 17 patient cases have been studied. Compared with standard optimization plus conversion to deliverable beams, deliverable-based optimization results show improved isodose coverage and a reduced dose to critical structures. Deliverable-based optimization results are close to the original nondeliverable optimization results, suggesting that IMRT can overcome the MLC limitations by adjusting individual beamlets. The use of deliverable-based optimization may reduce the need for empirical adjustment of objective function parameters and reoptimization of a plan to achieve desired results</title><text>Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) treatment planning typically</text><keywords>intensity modulated radiation therapy;treatment planning;beam delivery;beam optimization;fluence patterns;objective function parameters;deliverable dose distribution;empirical adjustment</keywords></doc>
<doc><title>Perfusion quantification using Gaussian process deconvolution (DSC-MRI) requires deconvolution to obtain the residual impulse response function (IRF). In this work, a method using the Gaussian process for deconvolution (GPD) is proposed. The fact that the IRF is smooth is incorporated as a constraint in the method. The GPD method, which automatically estimates the noise level in each voxel, has the advantage that model parameters are optimized automatically. The GPD is compared to singular value decomposition (SVD) using a common threshold for the singular values, and to SVD using a threshold optimized according to the noise level in each voxel. The comparison is carried out using artificial data as well as data from healthy volunteers. It is shown that GPD is comparable to SVD with a variable optimized threshold when determining the maximum of the IRF, which is directly related to the perfusion. GPD provides a better estimate of the entire IRF. As the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) increases or the time resolution of the measurements increases, GPD is shown to be superior to SVD. This is also found for large distribution volumes</title><text>The quantification of perfusion using dynamic susceptibility contrast MRI</text><keywords>perfusion quantification;Gaussian process deconvolution;dynamic susceptibility contrast MRI;residual impulse response function;singular value decomposition;noise level</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>Adjoint-based optimization of steady suction for disturbance control in incompressible flows single or multiple disturbances in quasi-three-dimensional incompressible boundary layers on a flat plate is investigated. The evolution of disturbances is analysed in the framework of the parabolized stability equations (PSE). A gradient-based optimization procedure is used and the gradients are evaluated using the adjoint of the parabolized stability equations (APSE) and the adjoint of the boundary layer equations (ABLE). The accuracy of the gradient is increased by introducing a stabilization procedure for the PSE. Results show that a suction peak appears in the upstream part of the suction region for optimal control of Tollmien-Schlichting (T-S) waves, steady streamwise streaks in a two-dimensional boundary layer and oblique waves in a quasi-three-dimensional boundary layer subject to an adverse pressure gradient. The mean flow modifications due to suction are shown to have a stabilizing effect similar to that of a favourable pressure gradient. It is also shown that the optimal suction distribution for the disturbance of interest reduces the growth rate of other perturbations.

<doc><title>The MAGNeT toolkit: design, implementation and evaluation connect a large number of machines via a fast interconnect or a large-scale network such as the Internet. This approach relies on the performance of the interconnect (or Internet) to enable fast, large-scale distributed computing. A detailed understanding of the communication traffic is required in order to optimize the operation of the entire system. Network researchers traditionally monitor traffic in the network to gain the insight necessary to optimize network operations. Recent work suggests additional insight can be obtained by also monitoring traffic at the application level.

<doc><title>High-performance numerical pricing methods constitutes a major component of financial management applications. The uncertainty of future events often makes analytic approaches infeasible and, hence, time-consuming numerical simulations are required. In the Aurora Financial Management System, pricing is performed on the basis of lattice representations of stochastic multidimensional scenario processes using the Monte Carlo simulation and Backward Induction methods, the latter allowing for the exploitation of shared-memory parallelism. We present the parallelization of a Backward Induction numerical pricing kernel on a cluster of SMPs using HPF+, an extended version of High-Performance Fortran. Based on language extensions for specifying a hierarchical mapping of data onto an SMP cluster, the compiler generates a hybrid-parallel program combining distributed-memory and shared-memory parallelism. We outline the parallelization strategy adopted by the VFC compiler and present an experimental evaluation of the pricing kernel on an NEC SX-5 vector supercomputer and a Linux SMP cluster, comparing a pure MPI version to a hybrid-parallel MPI/OpenMP version</title><text>The pricing of financial derivatives is an important field in finance and</text><keywords>finance;financial management;Aurora Financial Management System;pricing;Monte Carlo simulation;Backward Induction methods;numerical pricing kernel</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>Oxygen-enhanced MRI of the brain a physiological characterization of tissue beyond mere morphological representation. The purpose of this study was to develop evaluation techniques for such examinations using a hyperoxia challenge. Administration of pure oxygen was applied to test these techniques, as pure oxygen can be expected to induce relatively small signal intensity (SI) changes compared to CO/sub 2/-containing gases and thus requires very sensitive evaluation methods. Fourteen volunteers were investigated by alternating between breathing 100% O/sub 2/ and normal air, using two different paradigms of administration. Changes ranged from >30% in large veins to 1.71%+or-0.14% in basal ganglia and 0.82%+or-0.08% in white matter. To account for a slow physiological response function, a reference for correlation analysis was derived from the venous reaction. An objective method is presented that allows the adaptation of the significance threshold to the complexity of the paradigm used. Reference signal characteristics in representative brain tissue regions were established. As the presented evaluation scheme proved its applicability to small SI changes induced by pure oxygen, it can readily be used for similar experiments with other gases</title><text>Blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) contrast MRI is a potential method for</text><keywords>BOLD contrast MRI;oxygen-enhanced MRI;hyperoxia;brain;physiological response function;correlation analysis;venous reaction;significance threshold</keywords></doc>

As a result, nonhomogeneous spatiotemporal patterns may be induced by any initial setting of the CNN system when the strength of the system diffusion coupling exceeds a critical threshold. The critical coupling coefficient can be derived from the loaded cell impedance of the CNN system. Three well-known 1D map CNN's (namely, the logistic map CNN, the magnetic vortex pinning map CNN, and the spiral wave reproducing map CNN) are introduced to illustrate the applications of the local activity principle. In addition, we use the cell impedance to demonstrate the period-doubling scenario in the logistic and the magnetic vortex pinning maps</title><text>Discrete-time CNN systems are studied in this paper by the application of</text><keywords>discrete-time CNN systems;local activity criteria;discrete-map CNN;loaded cell impedance;Chua's local activity principle;nonhomogeneous spatiotemporal patterns;critical coupling coefficient;logistic map CNN;magnetic vortex pinning map CNN;spiral wave reproducing map CNN;period-doubling</keywords></doc>

This method is demonstrated on simulated imagery and on adaptive-optics-(AO)-compensated imagery taken by the Starfire Optical Range 3.5-m telescope that has been artificially undersampled. Also shown are the results of multiframe blind deconvolution of some of the highest quality optical imagery of low earth orbit satellites collected with a ground-based telescope to date. The algorithm used is a generalization of multiframe blind deconvolution techniques that include a representation of spatial sampling by the focal plane array elements based on a forward stochastic model. This generalization enables the random shifts and shape of the AO-compensated point spread function (PSF) to be used to partially eliminate the aliasing effects associated with sub-Nyquist sampling of the image by the focal plane array. The method could be used to reduce resolution loss that occurs when imaging in wide-field-of-view (FOV) modes</title><text>We describe a postprocessing methodology for reconstructing undersampled image</text><keywords>supersampling multiframe blind deconvolution resolution enhancement;adaptive optics compensated imagery;low earth orbit satellites;postprocessing methodology;randomly varying blur;image enhancement;simulated imagery;multiframe blind deconvolution;ground-based telescope;spatial sampling;focal plane array elements;forward stochastic model;random shifts;AO-compensated point spread function;aliasing effects;sub-Nyquist sampling;resolution loss</keywords></doc>
<doc><title>A network simplex algorithm with O(n) consecutive degenerate pivots flow problem, known as the network simplex algorithm. Due to degeneracy, cycling may occur in the network simplex algorithm. The cycling can be prevented by maintaining strongly feasible bases proposed by Cunningham (1976); however, if we do not impose any restrictions on the entering variables, the algorithm can still perform an exponentially long sequence of degenerate pivots. This phenomenon is known as stalling. Researchers have suggested several pivot rules with the following bounds on the number of consecutive degenerate pivots: m, n/sup 2/, k(k + 1)/2, where n is the number of nodes in the network, m is the number of arcs in the network, and k is the number of degenerate arcs in the basis. (Observe that k <or= n.) In this paper, we describe an anti-stalling pivot rule that ensures that the network simplex algorithm performs at most k consecutive degenerate pivots. This rule uses a negative cost augmenting cycle to identify a sequence of entering variables</title><text>We suggest a pivot rule for the primal simplex algorithm for the minimum cost</text><keywords>network simplex algorithm;degenerate pivots;degeneracy;cycling;stalling;anti-stalling pivot rule;negative cost augmenting cycle</keywords></doc>

To deal with these questions, we review the literature on innovation in order to see how social capital came to be added to the other forms of capital as an explanatory variable of innovation. In doing so, we have been led to follow the dominating view of the literature on social capital and innovation which claims that social capital cannot be captured through a single indicator, but that it actually takes many different forms that must be accounted for. Therefore, to the traditional explanatory variables of innovation, we have added five forms of structural social capital (business network assets, information network assets, research network assets, participation assets, and relational assets) and one form of cognitive social capital (reciprocal trust). In a context where empirical investigations regarding the relations between social capital and innovation are still scanty, this paper makes contributions to the advancement of knowledge in providing new evidence regarding the impact and the extent of social capital on innovation at the two decisionmaking stages considered in this study</title><text>This paper deals with two questions: Does social capital determine innovation</text><keywords>innovation;manufacturing firms;business network assets;information network assets;research network assets;participation assets;relational assets;cognitive social capital;structural social capital;reciprocal trust</keywords></doc>

Uncertainties are assumed for the load resistance R=R/sub O/(1+ delta /sub R/), inductance L=L/sub O/(1+ delta /sub L/), and capacitance C=C/sub O/(1+ delta /sub C/). The interest in these models is clearly motivated by the need to have models for switch-mode DC-DC converters that are compatible with robust control analysis, which require a model structure consisting of a nominal model and a norm-bounded modeling uncertainty. Therefore, robust stability analysis can be realized using standard mu -tools.

The improvement is especially striking at low mutation variances.

This system represents a simple model of an electrical power system involving three machines and an infinite bus. Apart from the possible occurrence of attractors representing pathological states, the contacts between the basins have a practical importance, from the point of view of the operation of a real electrical power system. With the aid of a global map of basins, one could hope to design an intervention strategy to boot the power system back into its normal state. Our method involves taking two-dimensional sections of the six-dimensional state space, and then determining the basins directly by numerical simulation from a dense grid of initial conditions. The relations among all the basins are given for a specific numerical example, that is, choosing particular values for the parameters in our model</title><text>As part of an ongoing project on the stability of massively complex electrical</text><keywords>basin configuration;six-dimensional model;electric power system;global geometric structure;infinite bus;attractors;pathological states;global map;state space</keywords></doc>

This experimental work was carried out to compare the performance of alternative control strategies in various manufacturing environments and to investigate the relationship between the 'control' and 'controlled' systems. The experimental test-bed presented in this paper consists of an agent-based control system (implemented in C++) and a discrete-event simulation model. Using this test-bed, various control strategies were tested on a benchmark manufacturing system by varying production volumes (to model the production system with looser/tighter schedules) and disturbance frequencies.

<doc><title>Handles and exception safety, Part 1. A simple handle class obvious way to do so is directly, but programmers who create complicated data structures often have trouble figuring out what parts of those data structures are safe to delete when. The classical method of dealing with such complexity is to hide it in a class. Such classes are typically called handles; the idea is to attach a handle object to another object that contains the actual data. The simplest form of a handle, which we have discussed in this article, is one in which each handle object corresponds to a single object from the inheritance hierarchy. Such handles are straightforward to use and to implement and tend to be intrinsically exception safe in almost all respects. The one exception hazard in such a class is typically the assignment operator. Assignment operators often test for self-assignment to avoid aliasing problems. As Herb Sutter has observed (2000), programs that need such tests are almost always exception unsafe. By rewriting the assignment operator, we ensure that we do not do anything irrevocable until the possibility of throwing an exception has passed. This strategy ensures that if an exception occurs while our assignment operator is executing, we do not corrupt the rest of our system</title><text>Every C++ program that uses inheritance must manage memory somehow.

The flux and speed estimation accuracy is guaranteed when the error between the actual current and observed current converges to zero.

With the current pressures on manufacturing, the management of information resources has become a critical issue. In particular, ensuring that personnel can access current information quickly and effectively when undertaking a specific task. This paper discusses some of the issues involved in, and the benefits of using, open hypermedia to manage and deliver a diverse range of information. While the paper concentrates on the problems specifically associated with manufacturing organizations, the problems are generic across other business sectors such as healthcare, defence and finance. The open hypermedia approach to information management and delivery allows a multimedia resource base to be used for a range of applications and it permits a user to have controlled access to the required information in an easily accessible and structured manner. Recent advancement in hypermedia also permits just-in-time support in the most appropriate format for all users.

<doc><title>Stochastic recurrences of Jackpot Keno implemented by Jupiters Network Gaming (JNG) in the Australian state of Queensland, and as controlled by the Queensland Office of Gaming Regulation (QOGR) (http://www.qogr.qld.gov.au/keno.shtml). The recurrences for the house net hold are derived and it is seen that these are piecewise linear with a ternary domain split, and further, the split points are stochastic in nature. Since this structure is intractable (Brockett and Levine, Statistics & Probability & their Applications, CBS College Publishing, 1984), estimation of house net hold obtained through an appropriately designed simulator using a random number generator with desirable properties is described. Since the model and simulation naturally derives hold given payscale, but JNG and QOGR require payscale given hold, an inverse problem was required to be solved. This required development of a special algorithm, which may be described as a stochastic binary search. Experimental results are presented, in which the simulator is used to determine jackpot pay-scales so as to satisfy legal requirements of approximately 75% of net revenue returned to the players, i.e., 25% net hold for the house (JNG). Details of the algorithm used to solve this problem are presented, and notwithstanding the stochastic nature of the simulation, convergence to a specified hold for the inverse problem has been achieved to within 0.1% in all cases of interest to date</title><text>We describe a mathematical model and simulation study for Jackpot Keno, as</text><keywords>stochastic recurrences;Jackpot Keno;mathematical model;simulation;Jupiters Network Gaming;house net hold;piecewise linear;ternary domain split;random number generator;inverse problem;stochastic binary search;probability;experimental results;legal requirement</keywords></doc>

Sources can modify the rate at which they send traffic to the network based on the feedback carried in the resource management cells. This is achieved by changing the encoding level. As the contention increases to network resources-bandwidth in this case-sources start reducing the rate at which they generate and send traffic. The efficiency of the scheme under different scheduling/drop policies and other operating conditions and environments is evaluated using simulation modeling. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis is applied to different parameters, such as queue size and averaging interval length, to investigate their impact on the performance metrics.

Central axis depth dose measurements and a series of profile scans at various depths were acquired in a water phantom using a Scanditronix type RK ion chamber. Source spatial distributions for the Monte Carlo calculations were reconstructed from in-air ion chamber measurements carried out across the two-dimensional beam profile at 100 cm downstream from the source. The in-air spatial distributions were found to have full width at half maximum of 4.7 and 1.3 cm, at 100 cm from the source, for the 10 and 50 MeV beams, respectively. Energy spectra for the 10 and 50 MeV beams were determined by simulating the components of the microtron treatment head using the code MCNP4B.

But there is a noticeable sex difference in use of computers among children. This article asks why computers are more attractive to boys than to girls and offers a cultural framework for explaining the apparent sex differences. Although the data are fragmentary, the world of computing seems to be more consistent with male adolescent culture than with feminine values and goals. Furthermore, both arcade and educational software is designed with boys in mind. These observations lead us to speculate that computing is neither inherently difficult nor uninteresting to girls, but rather that computer games and other software might have to be designed differently for girls. Programs to help teachers instill computer efficacy in all children also need to be developed</title><text>Computers are becoming ubiquitous in our society and they offer superb</text><keywords>women;culture of computing;sex difference;children;male adolescent culture;educational software;computer games;teachers</keywords></doc>
<doc><title>Women in computing history politics fill computing history. However, the recorded history is mainly composed of male achievements and involvements, even though women have played substantial roles. This situation is not unusual. Most science fields are notorious for excluding, undervaluing, or overlooking the accomplishments of their female scientists. As Lee points out, it is up to the historians and others to remedy this imbalance. Steps have been taken towards this goal through publishing biographies on women in technology, and through honoring the pioneers with various awards such as the GHC'97 Pioneering Awards, the WITI Hall of Fame, and the AWC Lovelace Award. A few online sites contain biographies of women in technology.

<doc><title>Applying genetic algorithms to solve the fuzzy optimal profit problem fuzzy optimization problem that arises in business and economics. In this problem, a fuzzy price is determined using a linear or a quadratic fuzzy demand function as well as a linear cost function. The objective is to find the optimal fuzzy profit, which is derived from the fuzzy price and fuzzy cost. Traditional methods for solving this problem are (1) the extension principle, and (2) using interval arithmetic and alpha -cuts. However, we argue that traditional methods for solving this problem are too restrictive to produce an optimal solution, and that an alternative approach is possibly needed. We use genetic algorithms to obtain an approximate solution for this fuzzy optimal profit problem without using membership functions. We not only give empirical examples to show the effectiveness of this approach, but also give theoretical proofs to validate correctness of the algorithm. We conclude that genetic algorithms can produce good approximate solutions when applied to solve fuzzy optimization problems</title><text>This study investigated the application of genetic algorithms in solving a</text><keywords>genetic algorithms;fuzzy optimization problem;fuzzy optimal profit problem;economics;business;fuzzy price;quadratic fuzzy demand function;linear cost function;approximate solution;theoretical proofs</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>The fully entangled fraction as an inclusive measure of entanglement applications state is a hard problem, even understanding the relevant experimental quantities that are related to entanglement is difficult. It may not be necessary, however, to quantify the entanglement of a state in order to quantify the quantum information processing significance of a state. It is known that the fully entangled fraction has a direct relationship to the fidelity of teleportation maximized under the actions of local unitary operations. In the case of two qubits we point out that the fully entangled fraction can also be related to the fidelities, maximized under the actions of local unitary operations, of other important quantum information tasks such as dense coding, entanglement swapping and quantum cryptography in such a way as to provide an inclusive measure of these entanglement applications. For two qubit systems the fully entangled fraction has a simple known closed-form expression and we establish lower and upper bounds of this quantity with the concurrence. This approach is readily extendable to more complicated systems</title><text>Characterizing entanglement in all but the simplest case of a two qubit pure</text><keywords>entanglement;quantum information processing;fully entangled fraction;fidelity;teleportation;entanglement swapping;quantum cryptography</keywords></doc>

Instead of calculating the prototype filters as spectral factors of a half-band filter, the design is based on the direct optimization of the low pass analysis filter using an objective function directly related to a perceptual criterion for image compression. This function is defined as the product of the theoretical coding gain and an index called the peak-to-peak ratio, which was shown to have high correlation with perceptual quality. A distinctive feature of the proposed technique is a procedure by which, given a "good" starting filter, "good" filters of longer lengths are generated. The results are excellent, showing a clear improvement in perceptual image quality. Also, we devised a criterion for constraining the coefficients of the filters in order to design wavelets with minimum ringing</title><text>This paper presents a new biorthogonal linear-phase wavelet design for image</text><keywords>high-performance wavelets;image coding;perceptual time domain criterion;biorthogonal linear-phase wavelet design;image compression;prototype filters;half-band filter;analysis filter;objective function;coding gain;peak-to-peak ratio;perceptual image quality</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>Securing the Internet routing infrastructure expectation of an even faster increase in the numbers of users and networked systems, resulted in the Internet assuming its position as a mass communication medium. At the same time, the emergence of an increasingly large number of application areas and the evolution of the networking technology suggest that in the near future the Internet may become the single integrated communication infrastructure. However, as the dependence on the networking infrastructure grows, its security becomes a major concern, in light of the increased attempt to compromise the infrastructure. In particular, the routing operation is a highly visible target that must be shielded against a wide range of attacks. The injection of false routing information can easily degrade network performance, or even cause denial of service for a large number of hosts and networks over a long period of time. Different approaches have been proposed to secure the routing protocols, with a variety of countermeasures, which, nonetheless, have not eradicated the vulnerability of the routing infrastructure. In this article, we survey the up-to-date secure routing schemes. that appeared over the last few years.

Several quantum algorithms have been developed which exploit the inherent property of quantum systems such as superposition of states and entanglement for efficiently performing certain tasks. The experimental implementation has been achieved on many quantum systems, of which nuclear magnetic resonance has shown the largest progress in terms of number of qubits. This paper describes the use of a spin-7/2 as a three-qubit system and experimentally implements the half-adder and subtractor operations. The required qubits are realized by partially orienting /sup 133/Cs nuclei in a liquid-crystalline medium, yielding a quadrupolar split well-resolved septet.

<doc><title>Cache invalidation and replacement strategies for location-dependent data in mobile environments popular in recent years. However, data caching strategies for LDISs have thus far received little attention. In this paper, we study the issues of cache invalidation and cache replacement for location-dependent data under a geometric location model. We introduce a new performance criterion, called caching efficiency, and propose a generic method for location-dependent cache invalidation strategies. In addition, two cache replacement policies, PA and PAID, are proposed. Unlike the conventional replacement policies, PA and PAID take into consideration the valid scope area of a data value. We conduct a series of simulation experiments to study the performance of the proposed caching schemes. The experimental results show that the proposed location-dependent invalidation scheme is very effective and the PA and PAID policies significantly outperform the conventional replacement policies</title><text>Mobile location-dependent information services (LDISs) have become increasingly</text><keywords>location-dependent information;cache replacement;cache invalidation;mobile location-dependent information services;data caching</keywords></doc>

The influence of pintle pin friction background described, a fairly detailed mathematical model of a contemporary car-trailer system is constructed and a baseline set of parameter values is given. In reduced form, the model is shown to give results in accordance with literature. The properties of the baseline combination are explored using both linear and non-linear versions of the model. The influences of damping at the pintle joint and of several other design parameters on the stability of the linear system in the neighbourhood of the critical snaking speed are calculated and discussed. Coulomb friction damping at the pintle pin is then included and simulations are used to indicate the consequent amplitude-dependent behaviour. The friction damping, especially when its level has to be chosen by the user, is shown to give dangerous characteristics, despite having some capacity for stabilization of the snaking motions. It is concluded that pintle pin friction damping does not represent a satisfactory solution to the snaking problem.

Single test evaluation of segmental metabolism, function and contractile reserve in patients with coronary artery disease and regional dysfunction provides information about myocardial glucose metabolism to diagnose myocardial viability. Additional information about the functional status is necessary. Comparison of tomographic metabolic PET with data from other imaging techniques is always hampered by some transfer uncertainty and scatter. We wanted to evaluate a new Fourier-based ECG-gated PET technique using a high resolution scanner providing both metabolic and functional data with respect to feasibility in patients with diseased left ventricles. Forty-five patients with coronary artery disease and at least one left ventricular segment with severe hypokinesis or akinesis at biplane cineventriculography were included. A new Fourier-based ECG-gated metabolic /sup 18/F-FDG-PET was performed in these patients. Function at rest and /sup 18/F-FDG uptake were examined in the PET study using a 36-segment model. Segmental comparison with ventriculography revealed a high reliability in identifying dysfunctional segments (>96%). /sup 18/F-FDG uptake of normokinetic/hypokinetic/akinetic segments was 75.4+or-7.5, 65.3+or-10.5, and 35.9+or-15.2% (p<0.001). In segments >or=70% /sup 18/F-FDG uptake no akinesia was observed. No residual function was found below 40% /sup 18/F-FDG uptake. An additional dobutamine test was performed and revealed inotropic reserve (viability) in 42 akinetic segments and 45 hypokinetic segments. ECG-gated metabolic PET with pixel-based Fourier smoothing provides reliable data on regional function. Assessment of metabolism and function makes complete judgement of segmental status feasible within a single study without any transfer artefacts or test-to-test variability.

The preferred solution was to develop a geographical information system (GIS) application allowing for a circuit query for the specific geographic areas it crosses and the density of load points of a given type within those areas. The query returns results based on the type of equipment analysis execution: wood pole, preventive maintenance for a line or cable replacement.

When calculating DVHs, the choice of voxel size is a compromise between computational speed (larger voxels) and accuracy (smaller voxels). We quantified the effect of voxel size on the accuracy of DVHs using an in-house computer program. The program was validated by comparison with a hand-calculated DVH for a single 0.4-U iodine-125 model 6711 seed. We used the program to find the voxel size required to obtain accurate DVHs of five iodine-125 prostate implant patients at our institution. One-millimeter cubes were sufficient to obtain DVHs that are accurate within 5% up to 200% of the prescription dose. For the five patient plans, we obtained good agreement with the VariSeed (version 6.7, Varian, USA) treatment planning software's DVH algorithm by using voxels with a sup-inf dimension equal to the spacing between successive transverse seed implant planes (5 mm). The volume that receives at least 200% of the target dose, V/sub 200/, calculated by VariSeed was 30% to 43% larger than that calculated by our program with small voxels. The single-seed DVH calculated by VariSeed fell below the hand calculation by up to 50% at low doses (30 Gy), and above it by over 50% at high doses (>250 Gy)</title><text>Cumulative dose-volume histograms (DVH) are crucial in evaluating the quality</text><keywords>cumulative dose-volume histograms;prostate /sup 125/I seed implants;radioactive seed prostate implants;voxel size;computational speed;in-house computer program</keywords></doc>

The theorem, while often very useful, is incomplete in the sense that it does not explicitly specify the family of maps for which the condition is met. Recently, under a typically weak additional assumption on the map, it was shown that Hadamard's condition is met if and only if the map is a homeomorphism with a Lipschitz continuous inverse. Here, an application is given concerning the relation between the L/sub p/ stability (with 1 <or= p < infinity ) of a nonlinear system and the stability of related linear systems. We also give a result that directs attention to a fundamental limitation concerning what can be proved about linearization and stability for a related familiar family of feedback systems</title><text>A theorem by Hadamard gives a two-part condition under which a map from one</text><keywords>Banach space;Hadamard's condition;Lipschitz continuous inverse;L/sub p/ stability;nonlinear system;linear systems;feedback systems</keywords></doc>

Because a DIRK (diagonally implicit RK) method cannot have stage order greater than 1, we introduce quasi stage order conditions and derive some of their properties for DIRKs. We use these conditions to derive a low-order DIRK method with embedded error estimator.

<doc><title>Simultaneous iterative reconstruction of emission and attenuation images in positron emission tomography from emission data only attenuation correction is mandatory. In case that no data are available for the calculation of the attenuation correction factors one can try to determine them from the emission data alone. However, it is not clear if the information content is sufficient to yield an adequate attenuation correction together with a satisfactory activity distribution. Therefore, we determined the log likelihood distribution for a thorax phantom depending on the choice of attenuation and activity pixel values to measure the crosstalk between both. In addition an iterative image reconstruction (one-dimensional Newton-type algorithm with a maximum likelihood estimator), which simultaneously reconstructs the images of the activity distribution and the attenuation coefficients is used to demonstrate the problems and possibilities of such a reconstruction. As result we show that for a change of the log likelihood in the range of statistical noise, the associated change in the activity value of a structure is between 6% and 263%. In addition, we show that it is not possible to choose the best maximum on the basis of the log likelihood when a regularization is used, because the coupling between different structures mediated by the (smoothing) regularization prevents an adequate solution due to crosstalk. We conclude that taking into account the attenuation information in the emission data improves the performance of image reconstruction with respect to the bias of the activities, however, the reconstruction still is not quantitative</title><text>For quantitative image reconstruction in positron emission tomography</text><keywords>image reconstruction;attenuation correction factors;log likelihood distribution;thorax phantom;activity pixel values;crosstalk;iterative image reconstruction;one-dimensional Newton-type algorithm;maximum likelihood estimator;activity distribution;attenuation coefficients;statistical noise;smoothing;attenuation information</keywords></doc>

In particular, it is asked whether a numerical integration method applied to the original system reaches the inherent regular ODE without conservation, i.e., whether the discretization and the decoupling commute in some sense. In general one cannot expect this commutativity so that additional difficulties like strong stepsize restrictions may arise. Moreover, abstract differential algebraic equations in infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces are introduced, and the index notion is generalized to those equations.

<doc><title>A case for end system multicast protocol layer for implementing multicast related functionality. However, more than a decade after its initial proposal, IP multicast is still plagued with concerns pertaining to scalability, network management, deployment, and support for higher layer functionality such as error, flow, and congestion control. We explore an alternative architecture that we term end system multicast, where end systems implement all multicast related functionality including membership management and packet replication. This shifting of multicast support from routers to end systems has the potential to address most problems associated with IP multicast. However, the key concern is the performance penalty associated with such a model. In particular, end system multicast introduces duplicate packets on physical links and incurs larger end-to-end delays than IP multicast. We study these performance concerns in the context of the Narada protocol. In Narada, end systems self-organize into an overlay structure using a fully distributed protocol. Further, end systems attempt to optimize the efficiency of the overlay by adapting to network dynamics and by considering application level performance. We present details of Narada and evaluate it using both simulation and Internet experiments. Our results indicate that the performance penalties are low both from the application and the network perspectives. We believe the potential benefits of transferring multicast functionality from end systems to routers significantly outweigh the performance penalty incurred</title><text>The conventional wisdom has been that Internet protocol (IP) is the natural</text><keywords>end system multicast;Internet protocol;protocol layer;IP multicast;network management;higher layer functionality;congestion control;membership management;packet replication;end-to-end delays;Narada protocol;overlay structure;distributed protocol;network dynamics;application level performance;simulation;Internet experiments;performance penalties</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>Watermarking techniques for electronic delivery of remote sensing images due to the large number of possible applications capable of exploiting remotely sensed data and images. Along with the increase of market potential, the need arises for the protection of the image products. Such a need is a very crucial one, because the Internet and other public/private networks have become preferred means of data exchange. A critical issue arising when dealing with digital image distribution is copyright protection. Such a problem has been largely addressed by resorting to watermarking technology. A question that obviously arises is whether the requirements imposed by remote sensing imagery are compatible with existing watermarking techniques. On the basis of these motivations, the contribution of this work is twofold: assessment of the requirements imposed by remote sensing applications on watermark-based copyright protection, and modification of two well-established digital watermarking techniques to meet such constraints. More specifically, the concept of near-lossless watermarking is introduced and two possible algorithms matching such a requirement are presented. Experimental results are shown to measure the impact of watermark introduction on a typical remote sensing application, i.e., unsupervised image classification</title><text>Earth observation missions have recently attracted a growing interest, mainly</text><keywords>remote sensing images;electronic delivery;watermarking techniques;Earth observation missions;copyright protection;digital watermarking;near-lossless watermarking;digital image distribution;unsupervised image classification</keywords></doc>

We calculate the fidelity as a function of decoherence rates and angles of a state to be teleported. It is found that the average fidelity and the range of states to be accurately teleported depend on types of noises acting on quantum channels. If the quantum channels are subject to isotropic noise, the average fidelity decays to 1/2, which is smaller than the best possible value of 2/3 obtained only by the classical communication. On the other hand, if the noisy quantum channel is modeled by a single Lindblad operator, the average fidelity is always greater than 2/3</title><text>We investigate quantum teleportation through noisy quantum channels by solving</text><keywords>fidelity;quantum teleportation;noisy quantum channels;quantum channels;classical communication;Lindblad operator;isotropic noise</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>Integrate-and-fire neurons driven by correlated stochastic input analytical models that explicitly include correlations are hard to solve analytically, so their influence on a neuron's response has been difficult to ascertain. To gain some intuition on this problem, we studied the firing times of two simple integrate-and-fire model neurons driven by a correlated binary variable that represents the total input current. Analytic expressions were obtained for the average firing rate and coefficient of variation (a measure of spike-train variability) as functions of the mean, variance, and correlation time of the stochastic input. The results of computer simulations were in excellent agreement with these expressions. In these models, an increase in correlation time in general produces an increase in both the average firing rate and the variability of the output spike trains. However, the magnitude of the changes depends differentially on the relative values of the input mean and variance: the increase in firing rate is higher when the variance is large relative to the mean, whereas the increase in variability is higher when the variance is relatively small. In addition, the firing rate always tends to a finite limit value as the correlation time increases toward infinity, whereas the coefficient of variation typically diverges. These results suggest that temporal correlations may play a major role in determining the variability as well as the intensity of neuronal spike trains</title><text>Neurons are sensitive to correlations among synaptic inputs.

<doc><title>Operations that do not disturb partially known quantum states chosen from the known set of states. We present a principle that gives a definite distinction between the operations that preserve the states of the system and those that disturb the states. The principle is derived by alternately applying a fundamental property of classical signals and a fundamental property of quantum ones. The principle can be cast into a simple form by using a decomposition of the relevant Hilbert space, which is uniquely determined by the set of possible states. The decomposition implies the classification of the degrees of freedom of the system into three parts depending on how they store the information on the initially chosen state: one storing it classically, one storing it nonclassically, and the other one storing no information. Then the principle states that the nonclassical part is inaccessible and the classical part is read-only if we are to preserve the state of the system. From this principle, many types of no-cloning, no-broadcasting, and no-imprinting conditions can easily be derived in general forms including mixed states. It also gives a unified view on how various schemes of quantum cryptography work. The principle helps one to derive optimum amount of resources (bits, qubits, and ebits) required in data compression or in quantum teleportation of mixed-state ensembles</title><text>Consider a situation in which a quantum system is secretly prepared in a state</text><keywords>partially known quantum states;quantum system;classical signals;Hilbert space;degrees of freedom;nonclassical part;quantum cryptography;bits;qubits;ebits;quantum teleportation;mixed-state ensembles</keywords></doc>

This is an extension of the pattern matching problem into the quantum domain. Assuming that these states are known a priori to belong to a certain parametric family of pure qubit systems, we derive two kinds of matching strategies. The first one is a semiclassical strategy that is obtained by the natural extension of conventional matching strategies and consists of a two-stage procedure: identification (estimation) of the unknown template states to design the classifier (learning process to train the classifier) and classification of the input system into the appropriate pattern class based on the estimated results. The other is a fully quantum strategy without any intermediate measurement, which we might call as the universal quantum matching machine. We present the Bayes optimal solutions for both strategies in the case of K=1, showing that there certainly exists a fully quantum matching procedure that is strictly superior to the straightforward semiclassical extension of the conventional matching strategy based on the learning process</title><text>Suppose that three kinds of quantum systems are given in some unknown states</text><keywords>quantum learning;universal quantum matching machine;pattern class;pattern matching problem;quantum domain;qubit systems;matching strategies;semiclassical strategy;two-stage procedure;quantum strategy;Bayes optimal solutions;quantum matching procedure;semiclassical extension;matching strategy;learning process</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>Efficient transitive closure reasoning in a combined class/part/containment hierarchy representation and reasoning systems. They are used for inheritance, classification and transitive closure reasoning. Part hierarchies are also important in artificial intelligence. Other hierarchies, e.g. containment hierarchies, have received less attention in artificial intelligence. This paper presents an architecture and an implementation of a hierarchy reasoner that integrates a class hierarchy, a part hierarchy, and a containment hierarchy into one structure. In order to make an implemented reasoner useful, it needs to operate at least at speeds comparable to human reasoning. As real-world hierarchies are always large, special techniques need to be used to achieve this. We have developed a set of parallel algorithms and a data representation called maximally reduced tree cover for that purpose. The maximally reduced tree cover is an improvement of a materialized transitive closure representation which has appeared in the literature. Our experiments with a medical vocabulary show that transitive closure reasoning for combined class/part/containment hierarchies in near constant time is possible for a fixed hardware configuration</title><text>Class hierarchies form the backbone of many implemented knowledge</text><keywords>transitive closure reasoning;class hierarchy;part hierarchy;containment hierarchy;parallel algorithms;data representation;maximally reduced tree cover;materialized transitive closure representation;experiments;medical vocabulary;fixed hardware configuration;inheritance;part hierarchies;artificial intelligence;classification</keywords></doc>

As larger and more challenging MPC applications are considered, more attention needs to be focused on the construction and tailoring of efficient QP algorithms. In this study, we tailor and apply a new QP method, called QPSchur, to large MPC applications, such as cross directional control problems in paper machines. Written in C++, QPSchur is an object oriented implementation of a novel dual space, Schur complement algorithm. We compare this approach to three widely applied QP algorithms and show that QPSchur is significantly more efficient (up to two orders of magnitude) than the other algorithms. In addition, detailed simulations are considered that demonstrate the importance of the flexible, object oriented construction of QPSchur, along with additional features for constraint handling, warm starts and partial solution</title><text>Quadratic programming (QP) methods are an important element in the application</text><keywords>large-scale model predictive control;quadratic programming algorithms;QPSchur;cross directional control problems;paper machines;object oriented implementation;simulations;constraint handling;warm starts;partial solution</keywords></doc>
<doc><title>Packet spacing: an enabling mechanism for delivering multimedia content in computational grids systems like the Internet. Scientific applications that stream multimedia include remote computational steering of visualization data and video-on-demand teleconferencing over the Access Grid. However, UDP does not possess a self-regulating, congestion-control mechanism; and most best-effort traffic is served by congestion-controlled TCP. Consequently, UDP steals bandwidth from TCP such that TCP flows starve for network resources. With the volume of Internet traffic continuing to increase, the perpetuation of UDP-based streaming will cause the Internet to collapse as it did in the mid-1980's due to the use of non-congestion-controlled TCP. To address this problem, we introduce the counter-intuitive notion of inter-packet spacing with control feedback to enable UDP-based applications to perform well in the next-generation Internet and computational grids. When compared with traditional UDP-based streaming, we illustrate that our approach can reduce packet loss over 50% without adversely affecting delivered throughput</title><text>Streaming multimedia with UDP has become increasingly popular over distributed</text><keywords>streaming multimedia;UDP;Internet;remote computational steering;visualization data;inter-packet spacing;UDP-based streaming</keywords></doc>

In similar case retrieval, multiple indices are set up in order to characterize the queries and individual cases, then terms are given as values to each. The similarity measure between cases commonly used is defined using the rate at which the values provided from the corresponding indices match. In practice, however, values cannot be expected to be mutually exclusive. As a result, a natural expansion of this approach is to have relationships in which mutually similar meanings are reflected in the similarity measure between cases. In this paper the authors consider an auto-fuzzy thesaurus which gives the relationship for values between corresponding indices and a cross-fuzzy thesaurus which gives the relationship for values between mutually distinct indices, then defines a similarity measure between cases which considers the relationship of index values based on these thesauri. This definition satisfies the characteristics required for the operation of case-based retrieval even when one value is not necessarily given in the index. Finally, using a test similar case retrieval system, the authors perform a comparative analysis of the proposed similarity measure between cases and a conventional approach</title><text>A similarity measure between cases is needed in order to evaluate the degree of</text><keywords>corresponding indices;mutually distinct indices;case-based retrieval;similar case retrieval;auto-fuzzy thesaurus;cross-fuzzy thesaurus</keywords></doc>

However, this method works only for a certain class of chaotic systems with known parameters both in drive systems and response systems. Modification based on Lyapunov stability theory is proposed in order to overcome this limitation. An adaptive synchronization controller, which can make the states of two identical Rossler and Chen systems globally asymptotically synchronized in the presence of system's unknown constant parameters, is derived. Especially, when some unknown parameters are positive, we can make the controller more simple, besides, the controller is independent of those positive uncertain parameters. At last, when the condition that arbitrary unknown parameters in two systems are identical constants is cancelled, we demonstrate that it is possible to synchronize two chaotic systems. All results are proved using a well-known Lyapunov stability theorem.

The definition of run-time dead code is given and its side effect is discussed. To eliminate the imprecision caused by the run-time dead code, backward data-flow information must be used.

The formation of relatively stable long-term group associations (community in the broad sense of the term), is the scene on which a large share of human development occurs. As such it is a fundamental human value mobilizing diverse ideologies and sensitivities. The promise of realizing this value in a new domain naturally stirs up much excitement among optimistic observers of the Internet. At the same time, the eagerness to place hopes for community in a technical system flies in the face of an influential intellectual tradition of technology criticism. This eagerness seems even more naive in the light of the recent commercialization of so much Internet activity. Despite the widespread skepticism, we believe the growth of virtual community is significant for an inquiry into the democratization of technology. We show that conflicting answers to the central question of the present theoretical debate - Is community possible on computer networks? epsilon neralize from particular features of systems and software prevalent at different stages in the development of computer networking.

<doc><title>Multiple shooting using a dichotomically stable integrator for solving differential-algebraic equations dichotomically stable discretization is needed when solving a stiff boundary-value problem in ordinary differential equations (ODEs), when sharp boundary layers may occur at each end of the interval. A dichotomically stable implicit Runge-Kutta method, using the 3-stage, fourth-order, Lobatto IIIA formulae, has been implemented in a variable step-size initial-value integrator, which could be used in a multiple-shooting approach. In the case of index-one differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) the use of the Lobatto IIIA formulae has an advantage, over a comparable Gaussian method, that the order is the same for both differential and algebraic variables, and there is no need to treat them separately. The ODE integrator has been adapted for the solution of index-one DAEs, and the resulting integrator (SYMDAE) has been inserted into the multiple-shooting code (MSHDAE) previously developed by R. Lamour for differential-algebraic boundary-value problems. The standard version of MSHDAE uses a BDF integrator, which is not dichotomically stable, and for some stiff test problems this fails to integrate across the interval of interest, while the dichotomically stable integrator SYMDAE encounters no difficulty. Indeed, for such problems, the modified version of MSHDAE produces an accurate solution, and within limits imposed by computer word length, the efficiency of the solution process improves with increasing stiffness. For some nonstiff problems, the solution is also entirely satisfactory</title><text>In previous work by the first author, it has been established that a</text><keywords>multiple shooting;stiff boundary-value problem;ordinary differential equations;implicit Runge-Kutta method;Lobatto IIIA formulae;initial-value integrator;dichotomically stable integrator;differential-algebraic equations</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>Global action rules in distributed knowledge systems answering system based on distributed knowledge mining. The notion of an action rule was introduced by Z. Ras and A. Wieczorkowska (2000) and its application domain e-business was taken. In this paper, we generalize the notion of action rules in a similar way to handling global queries. Mainly, when values of attributes for a given customer, used in action rules, can not be easily changed by business user, definitions of these attributes are extracted from other sites of a distributed knowledge system. To be more precise, attributes at every site of a distributed knowledge system are divided into two sets: stable and flexible. Values of flexible attributes, for a given consumer, sometime can be changed and this change can be influenced and controlled by a business user. However, some of these changes (for instance to the attribute "profit') can not be done directly to a chosen attribute. In this case, definitions of such an attribute in terms of other attributes have to be learned. These new definitions are used to construct action rules showing what changes in values of flexible attributes, for a given consumer, are needed in order to re-classify this consumer the way business user wants. But, business user may be either unable or unwilling to proceed with actions leading to such changes. In all such cases we may search for definitions of these flexible attributes looking at either local or remote sites for help</title><text>Previously Z. Ras and J.M.

<doc><title>A new approach to the d-MC problem components in which the reliability can be computed in terms of the lower bound points of level d, called d-Mincuts (d-MCs). Such systems (electric power, transportation, etc.) may be regarded as flow networks whose arcs have independent, discrete, limited and multi-valued random capacities. In this paper, all MCs are assumed to be known in advance, and the authors focused on how to verify each d-MC candidate before using d-MCs to calculate the network reliability. The proposed algorithm is more efficient than existing algorithms. The algorithm runs in O(p sigma mn) time, a significant improvement over the previous O(p sigma m/sup 2/) time bounds based on max-flow/min-cut, where p and or are the number of MCs and d-MC candidates, respectively. It is simple, intuitive and uses no complex data structures. An example is given to show how all d-MC candidates are found and verified by the proposed algorithm.

The conditions imply storage functions satisfying a dissipation inequality. A class of storage functions allowing unique reconstruction of a passive dynamical system is defined. These results are illustrated by an example of a linear system with fading memory. An important, for practical application, class of the linear relaxation systems without direct input-output interaction is considered. A necessary condition for dynamical systems to be of the relaxation type is obtained for this class. The condition is connected with the existence of a unique quadratic Lyapunov function satisfying the complete monotonicity condition. This unique Lyapunov function corresponds to a "standard" thermodynamic potential in a compact family of potentials in the nonequilibrium thermodynamics. The results obtained can be useful in automatic control, mechanics of viscoelastic materials, and various applications in physics and the system theory</title><text>For nonlinear time-invariant input-output dynamical systems the passivity</text><keywords>storage functionals;passive dynamical systems;nonlinear time-invariant input-output dynamical systems;dissipation inequality;linear system;fading memory;necessary condition;unique quadratic Lyapunov function;complete monotonicity condition;thermodynamic potential;nonequilibrium thermodynamics;automatic control;mechanics;viscoelastic materials</keywords></doc>

We propose an analytic model to investigate this TTL-based algorithm for frequently accessed data. The analytic model is validated against simulation experiments. Our study quantitatively indicates how the TTL-based algorithm reduces the wireless communication cost by increasing the probability of stale accesses.

<doc><title>Ride quality evaluation of an actively-controlled stretcher for an ambulance transportation using an actively-controlled stretcher (ACS). The ride quality of a conventional stretcher and an assistant driver's seat is also compared. Braking during ambulance transportation generates negative foot-to-head acceleration in patients and causes blood pressure to rise in the patient's head. The ACS absorbs the foot-to-head acceleration by changing the angle of the stretcher, thus reducing the blood pressure variation. However, the ride quality of the ACS should be investigated further because the movement of the ACS may cause motion sickness and nausea. Experiments of ambulance transportation, including rapid acceleration and deceleration, are performed to evaluate the effect of differences in posture of the transported subject on the ride quality; the semantic differential method and factor analysis are used in the investigations. Subjects are transported using a conventional stretcher with head forward, a conventional stretcher with head backward, the ACS, and an assistant driver's seat for comparison with transportation using a stretcher. Experimental results show that the ACS gives the most comfortable transportation when using a stretcher. Moreover, the reduction of the negative foot-to-head acceleration at frequencies below 0.2 Hz and the small variation of the foot-to-head acceleration result in more comfortable transportation. Conventional transportation with the head forward causes the worst transportation, although the characteristics of the vibration of the conventional stretcher seem to be superior to that of the ACS</title><text>This study considers the subjective evaluation of ride quality during ambulance</text><keywords>actively-controlled stretcher;ambulance;ride quality evaluation;subjective evaluation;ambulance transportation;conventional stretcher;braking;negative foot-to-head acceleration;blood pressure variation;motion sickness;nausea;rapid acceleration;transported subject;semantic differential method;factor analysis;head forward;head backward;comfortable transportation;vibration</keywords></doc>

If the caller forgets the name, the system fails to provide service for the caller. In this paper we propose a portable Auto Attendant System (AAS) with sophisticated dialog structure that gives a caller more flexibility while calling. The caller may interact with the system to request a phone number by providing just a work area, specialty, surname, or title, etc. If the party is absent, the system may provide extra information such as where he went, when he will be back, and what he is doing. The system is built modularly, with components such as speech recognizer, language model, dialog manager and text-to-speech that can be replaced if necessary. By simply changing the personnel record database, the system can easily be ported to other companies. The sophisticated dialog manager applies many strategies to allow natural interaction between user and system. Functions such as fuzzy request, user repairing, and extra information query, which are not provided by other systems, are integrated into our system. Experimental results and comparisons to other systems show that our approach provides a more user friendly and natural interaction for auto attendant system</title><text>An attendant system connects the caller to the party he/she wants to talk to.</text><keywords>attendant system;Auto Attendant System;fuzzy request;dialog manager;speech recognizer</keywords></doc>

An algorithm for wedged beams wedge/(x,y), describing the transmission of a wedged photon beam through a patient. This in an extension of the method that we have published for open (nonwedged) fields [Med. Phys. 25, 830-840 (1998)]. Transmission functions for open fields are being used in our clinic for prediction of portal dose images (PDI, i.e., a dose distribution behind the patient in a plane normal to the beam axis), which are compared with PDIs measured with an electronic portal imaging device (EPID). The calculations are based on the planning CT scan of the patient and on the irradiation geometry as determined in the treatment planning process. Input data for the developed algorithm for wedged beams are derived from (the already available) measured input data set for transmission prediction in open beams, which is extended with only a limited set of measurements in the wedged beam. The method has been tested for a PDI plane at 160 cm from the focus, in agreement with the applied focus-to-detector distance of our fluoroscopic EPIDs. For low and high energy photon beams (6 and 23 MV) good agreement (~1%) has been found between calculated and measured transmissions for a slab and a thorax phantom</title><text>A method is presented for calculation of a two-dimensional function, T/sub</text><keywords>portal dose image prediction;dosimetric treatment verification;radiotherapy;two-dimensional function;wedged photon beam;planning CT scan;irradiation geometry;high energy photon beams;thorax phantom;electronic portal imaging devices;open beams</keywords></doc>

As a result the reduced equivalent moving is formed, being described by the scalar equation which in many important cases can be integrated directly. On the basis of the equation obtained solving a synthesis task is carried out and can be reduced to algebraic or integral inequalities.

The first is to find a method of checking if a net is conflict-avoidable (i.e., if it possesses a conflict-free fair run). The second is to find a method of rebuilding any net to a totally conflict-avoidable net (i.e., a net possessing a conflict-free fair run in every one process) with the same behaviour. The main results are the following: 1. The proof of decidability, for elementary nets, of the problem of existence of a conflict-avoidable fair process (and an algorithm producing all fair runs). 2. Construction, for an arbitrary given elementary net, of a totally conflict-avoidable net with the same behaviour. The net, completed this way, has the same behaviour as the original one. Moreover, it is totally conflict-avoidable, and its execution may be supervised (in order to ensure conflict-freeness) by the reduced case graph built by the algorithm of the former section</title><text>Deals with analysis of elementary Petri nets with respect to possibilities of</text><keywords>conflict-free executions;elementary Petri nets;conflict-free fair run;totally conflict-avoidable net;decidability;reduced case graph</keywords></doc>
<doc><title>Formalization of weighted factors analysis elicitation, representation, and manipulation of knowledge about a given problem, generally at a high and strategic level. Central to this proposal is that a group of experts in the area of the problem can identify a hierarchy of factors with positive or negative influences on the problem outcome. The tangible output of WeFA is a directed weighted graph called a WeFA graph. This is a set of nodes denoting factors that can directly or indirectly influence an overall aim of the graph. The aim is also represented by a node. Each directed arc is a direct influence of one factor on another. A chain of directed arcs indicates an indirect influence. The influences may be identified as either positive or negative. For example, sales and costs are two factors that influence the aim of profitability in an organization. Sales has a positive influence on profitability and costs has a negative influence on profitability. In addition, the relative significance of each influence is represented by a weight. We develop Binary WeFA which is a variant of WeFA where the factors in the graph are restricted to being either true or false. Imposing this restriction on a WeFA graph allows us to be more precise about the meaning of the graph and of reasoning in it. Binary WeFA is a new proposal that provides a formal yet sufficiently simple language for logic-based argumentation for use by business people in decision-support and knowledge management. Whilst Binary WeFA is expressively simpler than other logic-based argumentation formalisms, it does incorporate a novel formalization of the notion of significance</title><text>Weighted factors analysis (WeFA) has been proposed as a new approach for</text><keywords>weighted factors analysis;significance;WeFA graph;directed arc;profitability;organization;Binary WeFA;reasoning;logic-based argumentation;decision-support;knowledge management;directed weighted graph</keywords></doc>

Pastry is used to create and manage groups and to build efficient multicast trees for the dissemination of messages to each group. Scribe provides best-effort reliability guarantees, and we outline how an application can extend Scribe to provide stronger reliability.

The application domain of data broadcast will be widely expanded in the near future, where the client is expected to perform complex queries or transactions on the broadcast data. To reduce the access latency for processing the complex query, it is beneficial to place the data accessed in a query close to each other on the broadcast channel. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm to determine the allocation of the data on the broadcast channel such that frequently co-accessed data are not only allocated close to each other, but also in a particular order which optimizes the performance of query processing. Our mechanism is based on the well-known problem named optimal linear ordering.

<doc><title>Control of a coupled map lattice model for vortex shedding in the wake of a cylinder complex wake structures such as lace-like patterns, vortex dislocations and frequency cells. These structures have been observed in experiments and numerical simulations, and are predicted by a previously developed low-order coupled map lattice (CML). The discrete (in time and space) CML models consist of a series of diffusively coupled circle map oscillators along the cable span. Motivated by a desire to modify the complex wake patterns behind flexible vibrating cables, we have studied the addition of control terms into the highly efficient CML models and explored the resulting dynamics. Proportional, adaptive proportional and discontinuous non-linear (DNL) control methods were used to derive the control laws. The first method employed occasional proportional feedback. The adaptive method used spatio-temporal feedback control. The DNL method used a discontinuous feedback linearization procedure, and the controller was designed for the resulting linearized system using eigenvalue assignment. These techniques were applied to a modeled vortex dislocation structure in the wake of a vibrating cable in uniform freestream flow. Parallel shedding patterns were achieved for a range of forcing frequency-forcing amplitude combinations studied to validate the control theory. The adaptive proportional and DNL methods were found to be more effective than the proportional control method due to the incorporation of a spatially varying feedback gain across the cylinder span. The DNL method was found to be the most efficient controller of the low-order CML model. The required control level across the cable span was correlated to the 1/1 lock-on behavior of the temporal circle map</title><text>The flow behind a vibrating flexible cable at low Reynolds numbers can exhibit</text><keywords>coupled map lattice;vortex shedding;wake;proportional feedback;coupled circle map oscillators;spatio-temporal feedback control;temporal circle map;vortex dislocation;cylinder;low Reynolds numbers;vortex dislocations;vibrating flexible cable</keywords></doc>

Good examples of production systems that allow for batch processing are ovens found in the aircraft industry and in semiconductor manufacturing. In this paper we study the issue of dynamic scheduling of such systems within the context of multi-stage flow shops. So far, a great deal of research has concentrated on the development of control strategies, which only address the batch stage. This paper proposes an integral scheduling approach that also includes succeeding stages. In this way, we aim for shop optimization, instead of optimizing performance for a single stage. Our so-called look-ahead strategy adapts its scheduling decision to shop status, which includes information on a limited number of near-future arrivals. In particular, we study a two-stage flow shop, in which the batch stage is succeeded by a serial stage. The serial stage may be realized by a single machine or by parallel machines. Through an extensive simulation study it is demonstrated how shop performance can be improved by the proposed strategy relative to existing strategies</title><text>Batch servicing is a common way of benefiting from economies of scale in</text><keywords>adaptive scheduling;batch servers;flow shops;batch servicing;manufacturing operations;production systems;ovens;aircraft industry;semiconductor manufacturing;dynamic scheduling;multi-stage flow shops;control strategies;integral scheduling approach;shop optimization;look-ahead strategy;near-future arrivals;two-stage flow shop;single machine;parallel machines;simulation study</keywords></doc>
<doc><title>A formal framework for viewpoint consistency important. Each viewpoint offers a different perspective on the target system and system development involves parallel refinement of the multiple views. Viewpoint related approaches have been considered in a number of different guises by a spectrum of researchers. Our work particularly focuses on the use of viewpoints in open distributed processing (ODP) which is an ISO/ITU standardisation framework. The requirements of viewpoint modelling in ODP are very broad and, hence, demanding. Multiple viewpoints, though, prompt the issue of consistency between viewpoints. This paper describes a very general interpretation of consistency which we argue is broad enough to meet the requirements of consistency in ODP. We present a formal framework for this general interpretation; highlight basic properties of the interpretation and locate restricted classes of consistency.

<doc><title>On fractal dimension in information systems. Toward exact sets in infinite information systems notions in rough set theory. They are however defined in the setting of a finite information system i.e. an information system having finite numbers of objects as well as attributes. In theoretical studies e.g. of topological properties of rough sets, one has to trespass this limitation and to consider information systems with potentially unbound number of attributes. In such setting, the notions of rough and exact sets may be defined in terms of topological operators of interior and closure with respect to an appropriate topology following the ideas from the finite case, where it is noticed that in the finite case rough-set-theoretic operators of lower and upper approximation are identical with the interior, respectively, closure operators in topology induced by equivalence classes of the indiscernibility relation. Extensions of finite information systems are also desirable from application point of view in the area of knowledge discovery and data mining, when demands of e.g. mass collaboration and/or huge experimental data call for need of working with large data tables so the sound theoretical generalization of these cases is an information system with the number of attributes not bound in advance by a fixed integer i.e. an information system with countably but infinitely many attributes, In large information systems, a need arises for qualitative measures of complexity of concepts involved free of parameters, cf. e.g. applications for the Vapnik-Czervonenkis dimension.

The drive system consists of a three-level voltage-source converter with active front end and a synchronous motor. The drive has most recently been applied to a main strip mill. It provides a maximum of 8.3-MW mechanical power with a rated motor voltage of 3 kV. Besides motor torque as the main control objective, the control system has to comply with a number of additional objectives and constraints like DC-link voltage regulation and balancing, current and torque harmonics, motor flux, and excitation</title><text>A high dynamic control system for the Alspa VDM 7000 medium-voltage drive was</text><keywords>medium-voltage drive;high dynamic control system;gate-turn-off thyristors;switching frequency;efficiency;three-level voltage-source converter;synchronous motor;strip mill;mechanical power;motor voltage;control objective;DC-link voltage regulation;torque harmonics;motor flux;excitation</keywords></doc>

Principal component analysis helps us to understand the definition of a statistical distance associated with each pixels, and using this distance it is possible to identify those pixels labeled as bad pixels. The spatiality of a pixel is also calculated. An assumption about the normality of the distribution of the distances of the pixels is revised. Although the influence on the robustness of the identification algorithm is negligible, the definition of a parameter related with this nonnormality helps to identify those principal components and eigenimages responsible for the departure from a multinormal distribution.

The most commonly cited problems in developing these systems are the unavailability of the experts and knowledge engineers and difficulties with the rule extraction process. Within the field of artificial intelligence, this has been called the 'knowledge acquisition' (KA) problem and has been identified as a major bottleneck in the expert system development process. Recent empirical research reveals that certain KA techniques are significantly more efficient than others in helping to extract certain types of knowledge within specific problem domains. This paper presents a mapping between these empirical studies and a generic taxonomy of expert system problem domains. To accomplish this, we first examine the range of problem domains and suggest a mapping of accounting and finance tasks to a generic problem domain taxonomy. We then identify and describe the most prominent KA techniques employed in developing expert systems in accounting and finance. After examining and summarizing the existing empirical KA work, we conclude by showing how the empirical KA research in the various problem domains can be used to provide guidance to developers of expert systems in the fields of accounting and finance</title><text>Since the mid-1980s, expert systems have been developed for a variety of</text><keywords>knowledge acquisition;expert systems;accounting;finance;rule extraction process;artificial intelligence;problem domain taxonomy</keywords></doc>

Swindale et al. think it is inappropriate to apply the standards of proof required in mathematics to the acceptance or rejection of scientific hypotheses. To give some examples, showing that data are well described by a linear model does not rule out an infinity of other possible models that might give better descriptions of the data. Proving in a mathematical sense that the linear model was correct would require ruling out all other possible models, a hopeless task. Similarly, to demonstrate that two DNA samples come from the same individual, it is sufficient to show a match between only a few regions of the genome, even though there remains a very large number of additional comparisons that could be done, any one of which might potentially disprove the match.

<doc><title>Use of neural networks in the analysis of particle size distribution by laser diffraction: tests with different particle systems size distribution (PSD) is usually limited by the occurrence of multiple scattering, which affects the angular distribution of light in highly concentrated suspensions, thus resulting in false calculations by the conventionally adopted algorithms. In this paper, a previously proposed neural network-based method is tested with different particle systems, in order to evaluate its applicability. In the first step of the study, experiments were carried out with solid-liquid suspensions having different characteristics of particle shape and size distribution, under varying solid concentrations. The experimental results, consisting of the angular distribution of light intensity, particle shape and suspension concentration, were used as input data in the fitting of neural network models (NN) that replaced the optical model to provide the PSD. The reference values of particle shape and PSD for the NN fitting were based on image analysis. Comparisons between the PSD values computed by the NN model and the reference values indicate that the method can be used in monitoring the PSD of particles with different shapes in highly concentrated suspensions, thus extending the range of application of forward laser diffraction to a number of systems with industrial interest</title><text>The application of forward light scattering methods for estimating the particle</text><keywords>particle size distribution;laser diffraction;neural network modeling;forward light scattering;multiple scattering;angular distribution of light;solid-liquid suspensions;image analysis</keywords></doc>

Retrieved information is either semi-structured or unstructured in format and its sources are extremely heterogeneous. In consequence, the task of efficiently gathering and extracting information from documents can be both difficult and tedious. Given this variety of sources and formats, many choose to use mediator/wrapper architecture, but its use demands a fast means of generating efficient wrappers. In this paper, we present a design for an automatic eXtensible Markup Language (XML)-based framework with which to generate wrappers rapidly. Wrappers created with this framework support a unified interface for a meta-search information retrieval system based on the Internet Search Service using the Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) standard. Greatly advantaged by the compatibility of CORBA and XML, a user can quickly and easily develop information-gathering applications, such as a meta-search engine or any other information source retrieval method. The two main things our design provides are a method of wrapper generation that is fast, simple, and efficient, and a wrapper generator that is CORBA and XML-compliant and that supports a unified interface</title><text>Given the ever-increasing scale and diversity of information and applications</text><keywords>unified interface;wrapper generator;integrated information retrieval;Internet;automatic eXtensible Markup Language;CORBA;meta-search engine</keywords></doc>

The synthesis algorithm is based upon simulations of breast tissue and the mammographic imaging process. Mammogram texture was synthesized by projections of simulated adipose tissue compartments. It was hypothesized that the synthetic and clinical texture have similar properties, assuming that the mammogram texture reflects the 3D tissue distribution. The size of the projected compartments was computed by mathematical morphology. The texture energy and fractal dimension were also computed and analyzed in terms of the distribution of texture features within four different tissue regions in clinical and synthetic mammograms. Comparison of the cumulative distributions of the mean features computed from 95 mammograms showed that the synthetic images simulate the mean features of the texture of clinical mammograms. Correlation of clinical and synthetic texture feature histograms, averaged over all images, showed that the synthetic images can simulate the range of features seen over a large group of mammograms. The best agreement with clinical texture was achieved for simulated compartments with radii of 4-13.3 mm in predominantly adipose tissue regions, and radii of 2.7-5.33 and 1.3-2.7 mm in retroareolar and dense fibroglandular tissue regions, respectively</title><text>We have evaluated a method for synthesizing mammograms by comparing the texture</text><keywords>mammogram synthesis;3D simulation;synthetic mammogram texture;adipose tissue compartments;3D tissue distribution;mathematical morphology;fractal dimension;cumulative distributions;synthetic images;dense fibroglandular tissue regions</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>A fundamental investigation into large strain recovery of one-way shape memory alloy wires embedded in flexible polyurethanes smart structures because of the large amount of actuation deformation and force that these materials are capable of producing when they are heated. Previous investigations have focused primarily on using single or opposing SMA wires exhibiting the two-way shape memory effect (SME) because of the simplicity with which the repeatable actuation behavior of the structure can be predicted. This repeatable actuation behavior is achieved at the expense of reduced levels of recoverable deformation. Alternatively, many potential smart structure applications will employ multiple SMA wires exhibiting a permanent one-way SME to simplify fabrication and increase the recoverable strains in the structure. To employ the one-way wires, it is necessary to investigate how they affect the recovery of large strains when they are embedded in a structure. In this investigation, the large strain recovery of a one-way SMA wire embedded in a flexible polyurethane is characterized using the novel deformation measurement technique known as digital image correlation. These results are compared with a simple actuation model and a three-dimensional finite element analysis of the structure using the Brinson model for describing the thermomechanical behavior of the SMA. Results indicate that the level of actuation strain in the structure is substantially reduced by the inelastic behavior of the one-way SMA wires, and there are significant differences between the deformations of the matrix material adjacent to the SMA wires and in the region surrounding it. The transformation behavior of the SMA wires was also determined to be volume preserving, which had a significant effect on the transverse strain fields</title><text>Shape memory alloys (SMAs) are being embedded in or externally attached to</text><keywords>strain recovery;one-way shape memory;flexible polyurethanes;alloy wires;SMA wires;actuation deformation;two-way shape memory effect;recoverable strains;flexible polyurethane;smart structures;three-dimensional finite element analysis;actuation strain;deformations;matrix material;transverse strain fields</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>Eliminating recency with self-review: the case of auditors' 'going concern' judgments in the 'going concern' judgments of staff auditors, but is successfully eliminated by the auditor's use of a simple self-review technique that would be extremely easy to implement in audit practice. Auditors who self-review are also less inclined to make audit report choices that are inconsistent with their going concern judgments. These results are important because the judgments of staff auditors often determine the type and extent of documentation in audit workpapers and serve as preliminary inputs for senior auditors' judgments and choices. If staff auditors' judgments are affected by recency, the impact of this bias may be impounded in the ultimate judgments and choices of senior auditors. Since biased judgments can expose auditors to significant costs involving extended audit procedures, legal liability and diminished reputation, simple debiasing techniques that reduce this exposure are valuable. The paper also explores some future research needs and other important issues concerning judgment debiasing in applied professional settings</title><text>This paper examines the use of self-review to debias recency.

<doc><title>Sensing and control of double-sided arc welding process quality. For thick material welding, the current practice is to use backing or multiple passes. The laser welding process, capable of achieving deep narrow penetration, can significantly improve welding productivity for such applications by reducing the number of passes. However, its competitiveness in comparison with traditional arc welding is weakened by its high cost, strict fit-up requirement, and difficulty in welding large structures. In this work, a different method, referred to as double-sided arc welding (DSAW) is developed to improve the arc concentration for arc welding. A sensing and control system is developed to achieve deep narrow penetration under variations in welding conditions. Experiments verified that the pulsed keyhole DSAW system developed is capable of achieving deep narrow penetration on a 1/2 inch thick square butt joint in a single pass</title><text>The welding industry is driven to improve productivity without sacrificing</text><keywords>double-sided arc welding;laser welding process;control system;thick material welding</keywords></doc>
<doc><title>Comparison of push and pull systems with transporters: a metamodelling approach multiproduct, multiline, multistage production system was used to compare the two systems. The effects of four factors (processing time variation, demand variation, transporters, batch size) on throughput rate, average waiting time in the system and machine utilization were studied. The study uses metamodels to compare the two systems. They serve a dual purpose of expressing system performance measures in the form of a simple equation and reducing computational time when comparing the two systems. Research shows that the number of transporters used and the batch size have a significant effect on the performance measures of both systems</title><text>Analyses push and pull systems with transportation consideration.

<doc><title>An adaptive sphere-fitting method for sequential tolerance control sequence of n operations on m machine tools. Because manufacturing datums cannot always match design constraints, some of the design specifications imposed on the part are usually satisfied by distinct subsets of the n operations prescribed in the process plan. Conventional tolerance control specifies a fixed set point for each operation and a permissible variation about this set point to insure compliance with the specifications, whereas sequential tolerance control (STC) uses real-time measurement information at the completion of one stage to reposition the set point for subsequent operations. However, it has been shown that earlier sphere-fitting methods for STC can lead to inferior solutions when the process distributions are skewed. This paper introduces an extension of STC that uses an adaptive sphere-fitting method that significantly improves the yield in the presence of skewed distributions as well as significantly reducing the computational effort required by earlier probabilistic search methods</title><text>The machining of complex parts typically involves a logical and chronological</text><keywords>machine tools;sequential tolerance control;adaptive sphere-fitting method;design constraints;compliance;real-time measurement information;skewed distributions;computational effort</keywords></doc>
<doc><title>Effect of multileaf collimator leaf width on physical dose distributions in the treatment of CNS and head and neck neoplasms with intensity modulated radiation therapy between two multileaf collimator (MLC) leaf widths (5 and 10 mm) in the treatment of CNS and head and neck neoplasms with intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). Three clinical patients with CNS tumors were planned with two different MLC leaf sizes, 5 and 10 mm, representing Varian-120 and Varian-80 Millennium multileaf collimators, respectively. Two sets of IMRT treatment plans were developed. The goal of the first set was radiation dose conformality in three dimensions. The goal for the second set was organ avoidance of a nearby critical structure while maintaining adequate coverage of the target volume. Treatment planning utilized the CadPlan/Helios system (Varian Medical Systems, Milpitas CA) for dynamic MLC treatment delivery. All beam parameters and optimization (cost function) parameters were identical for the 5 and 10 mm plans. For all cases the number of beams, gantry positions, and table positions were taken from clinically treated three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy plans. Conformality was measured by the ratio of the planning isodose volume to the target volume. Organ avoidance was measured by the volume of the critical structure receiving greater than 90% of the prescription dose (V/sub 90/). For three patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (T2-T4 N0-N2c M0) 5 and 10 mm leaf widths were compared for parotid preservation utilizing nine coplanar equally spaced beams delivering a simultaneous integrated boost. Because modest differences in physical dose to the parotid were detected, a NTCP model based upon the clinical parameters of Eisbruch et al. was then used for comparisons. The conformality improved in all three CNS cases for the 5 mm plans compared to the 10 mm plans. For the organ avoidance plans, V/sub 90/ also improved in two of the three cases when the 5 mm leaf width was utilized for IMRT treatment delivery. In the third case, both the 5 and 10 mm plans were able to spare the critical structure with none of the structure receiving more than 90% of the prescription dose, but in the moderate dose range, less dose was delivered to the critical structure with the 5 mm plan. For the head and neck cases both the 5 and 10*2.5 mm beamlets dMLC sliding window techniques spared the contralateral parotid gland while maintaining target volume coverage. The mean parotid dose was modestly lower with the smaller beamlet size (21.04 Gy vs 22.36 Gy). The resulting average NTCP values were 13.72% for 10 mm dMLC and 8.24% for 5 mm dMLC. In conclusion, five mm leaf width results in an improvement in physical dose distribution over 10 mm leaf width that may be clinically relevant in some cases. These differences may be most pronounced for single fraction radiosurgery or in cases where the tolerance of the sensitive organ is less than or close to the target volume prescription</title><text>The purpose of this work is to examine physical radiation dose differences</text><keywords>multileaf collimator leaf width;physical dose distributions;head and neck neoplasms;intensity modulated radiation therapy;CNS tumors;treatment planning;parotid preservation;conformal radiotherapy;single fraction radiosurgery;beamlet size</keywords></doc>

The Bill of Rights in the new Constitution includes a constitutional right of access to information held by the state. Since 1994 various initiatives have been taken by government and other bodies to promote such access. These include moves to reorganize government printing and publishing, restructure the government's public information services, make government information available on the Internet, and extend telephony and Internet access to poor communities.

<doc><title>Fast and accurate leaf verification for dynamic multileaf collimation using an electronic portal imaging device dynamic multileaf collimation (DMLC) is highly accurate leaf positioning. In our institution, leaf verification for DMLC was initially done with film and ionization chamber. To overcome the limitations of these methods, a fast, accurate and two-dimensional method for daily leaf verification, using our CCD-camera based electronic portal imaging device (EPID), has been developed. This method is based on a flat field produced with a 0.5 cm wide sliding gap for each leaf pair. Deviations in gap widths are detected as deviations in gray scale value profiles derived from the EPID images, and not by directly assessing leaf positions in the images. Dedicated software was developed to reduce the noise level in the low signal images produced with the narrow gaps. The accuracy of this quality assurance procedure was tested by introducing known leaf position errors. It was shown that errors in leaf gap as small as 0.01-0.02 cm could be detected, which is certainly adequate to guarantee accurate dose delivery of DMLC treatments, even for strongly modulated beam profiles. Using this method, it was demonstrated that both short and long term reproducibility in leaf positioning were within 0.01 cm (1 sigma ) for all gantry angles, and that the effect of gravity was negligible</title><text>A prerequisite for accurate dose delivery of IMRT profiles produced with</text><keywords>accurate leaf verification;dynamic multileaf collimation;electronic portal imaging device;accurate dose delivery;ionization chamber;two-dimensional method;CCD-camera based electronic portal imaging device;sliding gap;leaf pair;gap widths;gray scale value profiles;noise level;signal images;leaf position errors;modulated beam profiles;leaf positioning;gantry angles</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>A knowledge-based approach for managing urban infrastructures management, regulation, interactive and dynamic monitoring of urban infrastructures. This approach identifies the data and related treatments common to several municipal activities and defines the requirements and functionalities of the computer tools developed to improve the delivery and coordination of municipal services to the population. The resulting cooperative system called SIGIU is composed of a set of integrated operating systems (SYDEX) and the global planning and coordination system (SYGEC). The objective is to integrate the set of SYDEX and the SYGEC into a single coherent system for all the SIGIU's users according to their tasks, their roles, and their responsibilities within the municipal administration. SIGIU is provided by different measurement and monitoring instruments installed on some system's elements to be supervised. In this context, the information can be presented in different forms: video, pictures, data and alarms. One of SIGIU's objectives is the real-time management of urban infrastructures' control mechanisms. To carry out this process, the alarm control agent creates a mobile agent associated with the alarm, which is sent to a mobile station and warns an operator. Preliminary implementation results show that SIGIU supports effectively and efficiently the decision making process related to managing urban infrastructures</title><text>This paper presents a knowledge e-based approach dedicated to the efficient</text><keywords>knowledge-based approach;urban infrastructure management;regulation;dynamic monitoring;municipal activities;cooperative system;SIGIU;integrated operating systems;SYDEX;coordination system;SYGEC;video;real-time management;alarm control agent;mobile agent</keywords></doc>

After partitioning, a distributed intelligent system based on radial basis function neural network (RBF NN) and companion fuzzy system is suggested for FSE. The relevant theoretical analysis and procedure are presented in the paper.

Ventilation and perfusion images were simultaneously acquired using the flow-sensitive alternating inversion recovery (FAIR) method as volunteers alternately inhaled room air and 100% oxygen. Images of the T/sub 1/ distribution were calculated for five volunteers for both selective (T/sub 1f/) and nonselective (T/sub 1/) inversion. The average T/sub 1/ was 1360 ms+or-116 ms, and the average T/sub 1f/ was 1012 ms+or-112 ms, yielding a difference that is statistically significant (P<0.002). Excluding large pulmonary vessels, the average V/Q SI ratios were 0.355+or-0.073 for the left lung and 0.371+or-0.093 for the right lung, which are in agreement with the theoretical V/Q SI ratio. Plots of the WO SI ratio are similar to the logarithmic normal distribution obtained by multiple inert gas elimination techniques, with a range of ratios matching ventilation and perfusion. This MRI V/Q technique is completely noninvasive and does not involve ionized radiation. A limitation of this method is the nonsimultaneous acquisition of perfusion and ventilation data, with oxygen administered only for the ventilation data</title><text>This study investigates the distribution of ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) signal</text><keywords>human lung;ventilation-perfusion ratio;signal intensity;arterial spin labeling techniques;perfusion images;flow-sensitive alternating inversion recovery;logarithmic normal distribution;nonsimultaneous acquisition;MRI;multiple inert gas elimination</keywords></doc>

Various general-purpose simulation libraries and languages have been proposed, and among these some have the advantage of not requiring users to define anything other than the state vector, and not needing awareness of rollback under a platform which performs state control based on copies. However, because the state vectors must be defined as simple data structures without pointers, dynamic data structures such as a FIFO queue cannot be handled directly. Under the proposed class library, both the platform and the user can handle such structures in the same fashion that embedded data structures are handled. In addition, instead of all stored data, just the operational history can be stored and recovered efficiently at an effectively minimal cost by taking advantage of the first-in-first-out characteristics of the above data structures. When the kernel deletes past state histories during a simulation, garbage collection is also performed transparently using the corresponding method</title><text>The authors describe the implementation, use, and performance evaluation of a</text><keywords>FIFO queue;class library;performance evaluation;easy-to-use interface;queuing simulations;parallel discrete simulations;general-purpose simulation libraries;state vectors;dynamic data structures;embedded data structures;operational history;first-in-first-out characteristics;garbage collection</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>Domesticating computers and the Internet substantially over the past 25 years. In the beginning highly educated people, mostly men, in technical professions used computers for work, but over time a much broader range of people are using computers for personal and domestic purposes. This trend is still continuing, and over a shorter time scale has been replicated with the use of the Internet. The paper uses data from four national surveys to document how personal computers and the Internet have become increasingly domesticated since 1995 and to explore the mechanisms for this shift. Now people log on more often from home than from places of employment and do so for pleasure and for personal purposes rather than for their jobs. Analyses comparing veteran Internet users to novices in 1998 and 2000 and analyses comparing the change in use within a single sample between 1995 and 1996 support two complementary explanations for how these technologies have become domesticated. Women, children, and less well-educated individuals are increasingly using computers and the Internet and have a more personal set of motives than well-educated men. In addition, the widespread diffusion of the PC and the Internet and the response of the computing industry to the diversity in consumers has led to a rich set of personal and domestic services</title><text>The people who use computers and the ways they use them have changed</text><keywords>Internet;highly educated people;technical professions;domestic purposes;national surveys;personal computers;veteran Internet users;novices;women;children;computing industry;domestic services</keywords></doc>

The first paper describes the development of a methodology to synthesize possible general feature detection face sets. Six algorithms resulting from the synthesis have been designed and implemented on a SUN Workstation in C++ using ACIS as the geometric modelling system. In this paper, extensive tests and comparative analysis are conducted on the feature detection algorithms, using carefully selected components from the public domain, mostly from the National Design Repository. The results show that the new and enhanced algorithms identify face sets that previously published algorithms cannot detect. The tests also show that each algorithm can detect, among other types, a certain type of feature that is unique to it.

<doc><title>Valuing corporate debt: the effect of cross-holdings of stock and debt corporations own securities issued by other corporations. We assume that corporate debt can be valued as an option on corporate business asset value, and derive payoff functions when there exist cross-holdings of stock or debt between two firms. Next we show that payoff functions with multiple cross-holdings can be solved by the contraction principle. The payoff functions which we derive provide a number of insights about the risk structure of company cross-holdings. First, the Modigliani-Miller theorem can obtain when there exist cross-holdings between firms. Second, by establishing cross-shareholdings each of stock holders distributes a part of its payoff values to the bond holder of the other's firm, so that both firms can decrease credit risks by cross-shareholdings. In the numerical examples, we show that the correlation in firms can be a critical condition for reducing credit risk by cross-holdings of stock using Monte Carlo simulation.

<doc><title>Local search with constraint propagation and conflict-based heuristics fall into one of two main families: local search algorithms and systematic algorithms. Both families have their advantages. Designing hybrid approaches seems promising since those advantages may be combined into a single approach. In this paper, we present a new hybrid technique. It performs a local search over partial assignments instead of complete assignments, and uses filtering techniques and conflict-based techniques to efficiently guide the search. This new technique benefits from both classical approaches: a priori pruning of the search space from filtering-based search and possible repair of early mistakes from local search. We focus on a specific version of this technique: tabu decision-repair. Experiments done on open-shop scheduling problems show that our approach competes well with the best highly specialized algorithms</title><text>Search algorithms for solving CSP (Constraint Satisfaction Problems) usually</text><keywords>search algorithms;CSP;Constraint Satisfaction Problems;local search algorithms;systematic algorithms;partial assignments;filtering techniques;tabu decision-repair</keywords></doc>

In a typical DDoS attack, a large number of compromised hosts are amassed to send useless packets to jam a victim, or its Internet connection, or both. In the last two years, it was discovered that DDoS attack methods and tools are becoming more sophisticated, effective, and also more difficult to trace to the real attackers. On the defense side, current technologies are still unable to withstand large-scale attacks. The main purpose of this article is therefore twofold. The first one is to describe various DDoS attack methods, and to present a systematic review and evaluation of the existing defense mechanisms.

However, the DS X-control charts assume that the process standard deviation remains unchanged throughout the entire course of the statistical process control. Therefore, a complementary DS chart that can be used to monitor the process variation caused by changes in process standard deviation should be developed. In this paper, the development of the DS s-charts for quickly detecting small shift in process standard deviation for agile manufacturing is presented. The construction of the DS s-charts is based on the same concepts in constructing the DS X-charts and is formulated as an optimization problem and solved with a genetic algorithm. The efficiency of the DS s-control chart is compared with that of the traditional s-control chart.

Therefore, improving the replication quality of land-groove or pit structure and reducing the birefringence distribution are emerging as important criteria in the fabrication of high-density optical disk substrates. We control the transcribability and distribution of birefringence by inserting an insulation layer under the stamper during injection-compression molding of DVD RAM substrates. The effects of the insulation layer on the geometrical and optical properties, such as transcribability and birefringence distribution, are examined experimentally. The inserted insulation layer is found to be very effective in improving the quality of replication and leveling out the first peak of the gapwise birefringence distribution near the mold wall and reducing the average birefringence value, because the insulation layer retarded the growth of the solidified layer</title><text>As the need for information storage media with high storage density increases,</text><keywords>optical disk substrate;transcribability;birefringence distribution;insulation layer;information storage media;high storage density;digital video disks;smaller recording marks;thinner optical disk substrates;replication quality;land-groove;pit structure;fabrication;stamper;injection-compression molding;DVD RAM substrates;optical properties;gapwise birefringence distribution;mold wall</keywords></doc>

Design and optimization of the CVD process is necessary to satisfying strong global demand and ever increasing quality requirements for thin film production. Advantages of computer aided optimization include high design turnaround time, flexibility to explore a larger design space and the development and adaptation of automation techniques for design and optimization. A CVD reactor consisting of a vertical impinging jet at atmospheric pressure, for growing titanium nitride films, is studied for thin film deposition. Numerical modeling and simulation are used to determine the rate of deposition and film uniformity over a wide range of design variables and operating conditions. These results are used for system design and optimization. The optimization procedure employs an objective function characterizing film quality, productivity and operational costs based on reactor gas flow rate, susceptor temperature and precursor concentration. Parameter space mappings are used to determine the design space, while a minimization algorithm, such as the steepest descent method, is used to determine optimal operating conditions for the system. The main features of computer aided design and optimization using these techniques are discussed in detail</title><text>A study is carried out to design and optimize chemical vapor deposition (CVD)</text><keywords>chemical vapor deposition;material fabrication;optimization;operational costs;film quality;titanium nitride films;thin film growth;reactor gas flow rate;susceptor temperature;precursor concentration;parameter space mappings</keywords></doc>

Quantum lattice-gas algorithms (QLGA) running on such architectures have been shown to solve the diffusion equation and the nonlinear Burgers equations. In this report, we describe progress towards an ensemble nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) implementation of a QLGA that solves the diffusion equation. The methods rely on NMR techniques to encode an initial mass density into an ensemble of two-qubit quantum information processors. Using standard pulse techniques, the mass density can then manipulated and evolved through the steps of the algorithm.

Experimental results on bisimulation minimization in symbolic model checking contexts, however, are mixed. We explore bisimulation minimization as an optimization in symbolic model checking of invariance properties. We consider three bisimulation minimization algorithms. From each, we produce a BDD-based model checker for invariant properties and compare this model checker to a conventional one based on backwards reachability. Our comparisons, both theoretical and experimental, suggest that bisimulation minimization is not viable in the context of invariance verification, because performing the minimization requires as many, if not more, computational resources as model checking the unminimized system through backwards reachability</title><text>State space minimization techniques are crucial for combating state explosion.</text><keywords>bisimulation minimization;symbolic model checking;state space minimization techniques;state explosion;explicit-state verification tools;experimental results;optimization;invariance properties;backwards reachability;invariance verification</keywords></doc>

This facilitates the identification of the foreground and interfering strokes. A wavelet reconstruction process then iteratively enhances the foreground strokes and smears the interfering strokes so as to strengthen the discriminating capability of an improved Canny edge detector against the interfering strokes.

Wavelet representations have been used in a broad range of applications, including image compression, physical simulation and numerical analysis. In this paper, the authors construct a new class of wavelets, called four-point wavelets, based on an interpolatory four-point subdivision scheme. They are of local support, symmetric and stable. The analysis and synthesis algorithms have linear time complexity. Depending on different weight parameters w, the scaling functions and wavelets generated by the four-point subdivision scheme are of different degrees of smoothness. Therefore the user can select better wavelets relevant to the practice among the classes of wavelets. The authors apply the four-point wavelets in signal compression. The results show that the four-point wavelets behave much better than B-spline wavelets in many situations</title><text>Multiresolution analysis (MRA) and wavelets provide useful and efficient tools</text><keywords>four-point wavelets;multiresolution analysis;wavelet representations;image compression;physical simulation;numerical analysis;interpolatory four-point subdivision scheme;linear time complexity;weight parameters;scaling functions;B-spline wavelets</keywords></doc>

The proposed COG defuzzifier is specified by various design parameters such as the centers, widths, and modifiers of MFs. The design parameters are adjusted with the Lamarckian co-adaptation of learning and evolution, where the learning performs a local search of design parameters in an individual COG defuzzifier, but the evolution performs a global search of design parameters among a population of various COG defuzzifiers. This co-adaptation scheme allows to evolve much faster than the non-learning case and gives a higher possibility of finding an optimal solution due to its wider searching capability. An application to the truck backer-upper control problem of the proposed co-adaptive design method of COG defuzzifier is presented.

Unlike PLS, however, the approach discussed leads to straightforward models. This method also bears some similarity to latent root regression analysis (LRR) that was discussed by several authors.

In particular, we prove that many existing assumed conditions imply this sufficient condition. Thus, these conditions imply that the solution set of the P/sub 0/ function NCP is nonempty and bounded.

<doc><title>Meshed atlases for real-time procedural solid texturing texture atlas, a one-to-one mapping from an object's surface into its texture space. The method uses the graphics hardware to rasterize the solid texture coordinates as colors directly into the atlas. A texturing procedure is applied per-pixel to the texture map, replacing each solid texture coordinate with its corresponding procedural solid texture result. The procedural solid texture is then mapped back onto the object surface using standard texture mapping. The implementation renders procedural solid textures in real time, and the user can design them interactively. The quality of this technique depends greatly on the layout of the texture atlas. A broad survey of texture atlas schemes is used to develop a set of general purpose mesh atlases and tools for measuring their effectiveness at distributing as many available texture samples as evenly across the surface as possible. The main contribution of this paper is a new multiresolution texture atlas. It distributes all available texture samples in a nearly uniform distribution.

Their shortcomings, like inflexibility and the propensity to jam, stem from the use of mechanical orienting devices. Air jet based orienting devices can be implemented to overcome these limitations. Applications of passive and active air jet based orienting devices that replace conventional devices for the VBF are discussed.

<doc><title>Infrared-image classification using hidden Markov trees visible target subcomponents, with these dictated by the target-sensor orientation (target pose). An image often changes quickly with variable pose. We define a class as a set of contiguous target-sensor orientations over which the associated target image is relatively stationary with aspect. Each target is in general characterized by multiple classes. A distinct set of Wiener filters are employed for each class of images, to identify the presence of target subcomponents. A Karhunen-Loeve representation is used to minimize the number of filters (templates) associated with a given subcomponent. The statistical relationships between the different target subcomponents are modeled via a hidden Markov tree (HMT). The HMT classifier is discussed and example results are presented for forward-looking-infrared (FLIR) imagery of several vehicles</title><text>An image of a three-dimensional target is generally characterized by the</text><keywords>infrared-image classification;hidden Markov trees;target-sensor orientation;target pose;contiguous target-sensor orientations;Wiener filters;Karhunen-Loeve representation;HMT;FLIR imagery;vehicles</keywords></doc>
<doc><title>Mapping CCF to MARC21: an experimental approach pertaining to the conversion of Common Communication Format (CCF) into MARC21. In this era of global resource sharing, exchange of bibliographic records from one system to another is imperative in today's library communities. Instead of using a single standard to create machine-readable catalogue records, more than 20 standards have emerged and are being used by different institutions. Because of these variations in standards, sharing of resources and transfer of data from one system to another among the institutions locally and globally has become a significant problem. Addressing this problem requires keeping in mind that countries such as India and others in southeast Asia are using the CCF as a standard for creating bibliographic cataloguing records. This paper describes a way to map the bibliographic catalogue records from CCF to MARC21, although 100% mapping is not possible. In addition, the paper describes an experimental approach that enumerates problems that may occur during the mapping of records/exchanging of records and how these problems can be overcome</title><text>The purpose of this article is to raise and address a number of issues</text><keywords>MARC21;global resource sharing;library communities;machine-readable catalogue records;standards;India;southeast Asia</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>Favorable noise uniformity properties of Fourier-based interpolation and reconstruction approaches in single-slice helical computed tomography tomography (CT) data have been shown to have noise levels that are highly nonuniform relative to those in conventional CT. These noise nonuniformities can affect low-contrast object detectability and have also been identified as the cause of the zebra artifacts that plague maximum intensity projection (MIP) images of such volumes. While these spatially variant noise levels have their root in the peculiarities of the helical scan geometry, there is also a strong dependence on the interpolation and reconstruction algorithms employed. In this paper, we seek to develop image reconstruction strategies that eliminate or reduce, at its source, the nonuniformity of noise levels in helical CT relative to that in conventional CT. We pursue two approaches, independently and in concert. We argue, and verify, that Fourier-based longitudinal interpolation approaches lead to more uniform noise ratios than do the standard 360LI and 180LI approaches. We also demonstrate that a Fourier-based fan-to-parallel rebinning algorithm, used as an alternative to fanbeam filtered backprojection for slice reconstruction, also leads to more uniform noise ratios, even when making use of the 180LI and 360LI interpolation approaches</title><text>Volumes reconstructed by standard methods from single-slice helical computed</text><keywords>Fourier-based interpolation;single-slice helical computed tomography;reconstruction approaches;noise uniformity properties;conventional CT;Fourier-based fan-to-parallel rebinning algorithm;more uniform noise ratios;low-contrast object detectability;zebra artifacts</keywords></doc>

We present how a didactic laboratory can evaluate, in a statistical sense, the minimum synch error of this process (the other extreme, the maximum, is guaranteed by the code itself). The measurement set-up utilizes the global positioning system satellite constellation in 'common view' between two similar timing stations: one acts as a time server for the other, so the final timing difference at the second station represents the total synch error through the internet. Data recorded over batches of 10000 samples show a typical RMS value of 35 ms. This measurement configuration allows students to obtain a much better understanding of the synch task and pushes them, at all times, to look for an experimental verification of data results, even when they come from the most sophisticated 'black boxes' now readily available off the shelf</title><text>Nowadays many software packages allow you to keep the clock of your personal</text><keywords>personal computer clock;UTC timescale;internet;software packages;time servers;didactic laboratory;statistical sense;global positioning system satellite constellation;final timing difference;synch error</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>High-level language support for user-defined reductions workstations is critical to high performance because reductions are common in scientific codes and a potential source of bottlenecks. Yet in many high-level languages, a mechanism for writing efficient reductions remains surprisingly absent. Further, when such mechanisms do exist, they often do not provide the flexibility a programmer needs to achieve a desirable level of performance. In this paper, we present a new language construct for arbitrary reductions that lets a programmer achieve a level of performance equal to that achievable with the highly flexible, but low-level combination of Fortran and MPI. We have implemented this construct in the ZPL language and evaluate it in the context of the initialization of the NAS MG benchmark. We show a 45 times speedup over the same code written in ZPL without this construct. In addition, performance on a large number of processors surpasses that achieved in the NAS implementation showing that our mechanism provides programmers with the needed flexibility</title><text>The optimized handling of reductions on parallel supercomputers or clusters of</text><keywords>parallel supercomputers;reductions;language construct</keywords></doc>

The device can be easily incorporated into a conventional tensile test machine, and material resistance to buckling is measured as the buckling height versus the in-plane strain state. The design yields different but consistent buckling modes with easy changes of boundary conditions (either clamped or freed) and sample geometry. Experimental results are then used to verify a hybrid approach to buckling prediction, i.e., the combination of the FEM analysis and an energy-based analytical wrinkling criterion. The FEM analysis is used to obtain the stress field and deformed geometry in a complex forming condition, while the analytical solution is to provide the predictions less sensitive to artificial numerical parameters.

However, those methods are computationally inefficient due to repeated distance transformations and increased dimensions. In the paper, we propose a new method of modeling fast objects of arbitrary topology by using a surface evolution approach based on mathematical morphology. Given sensor data covering the whole object surface, the method begins with an initial approximation of the object by evolving a closed surface into a model topologically equivalent to the real object. The refined approximation is then performed using energy minimization.

As a generalization, we focus on the problem of maximizing the total flow value of a generalized flow in N with gains gamma (a) > 0 (a in A) where any arc-flow is bounded by a fixed proportion of the total flow value, where gamma (a)f(a) units arrive at the vertex w for each arc-flow f(a) (a identical to ( upsilon , w) in A) entering vertex upsilon in a generalized flow. Our main results are to propose two polynomial algorithms for this problem. The first algorithm runs in O(mM(n, m, B') log B) time, where B is the maximum absolute value among integral values used by an instance of the problem, and M(n, m, B') denotes the complexity of solving a generalized maximum flow problem in a network with n vertices, and m arcs, and a rational instance expressed with integers between 1 and B'.

<doc><title>Schedulability analysis of real-time traffic in WorldFIP networks: an integrated approach fieldbus standard EN-50170. It is particularly well suited to be used in distributed computer-controlled systems where a set of process variables must be shared among network devices. To cope with the real-time requirements of such systems, the protocol provides communication services based on the exchange of periodic and aperiodic identified variables. The periodic exchanges have the highest priority and are executed at run time according to a cyclic schedule. Therefore, the respective schedulability can be determined at pre-run-time when building the schedule table. Concerning the aperiodic exchanges, the situation is different since their priority is lower and they are bandied according to a first-come-first-served policy. In this paper, a response-time-based schedulability analysis for the real-time traffic is presented. Such analysis considers both types of traffic in an integrated way, according to their priorities. Furthermore, a fixed-priorities-based policy is also used to schedule the periodic traffic. The proposed analysis represents an improvement relative to previous work and it can be evaluated online as part of a traffic online admission control. This feature is of particular importance when a planning scheduler is used, instead of the typical offline static scheduler, to allow online changes to the set of periodic process variables</title><text>The WorldFIP protocol is one of the profiles that constitute the European</text><keywords>WorldFIP Networks;distributed computer-controlled systems;communication services;aperiodic exchanges;traffic online admission control;first-come-first-served policy;periodic process variables</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>Speaker adaptive modeling by vocal tract normalization normalization (VTN) along with experimental tests on three databases. We propose a new training method for VTN: By using single-density acoustic models per HMM state for selecting the scale factor of the frequency axis, we avoid the problem that a mixture-density tends to learn the scale factors of the training speakers and thus cannot be used for selecting the scale factor. We show that using single Gaussian densities for selecting the scale factor in training results in lower error rates than using mixture densities. For the recognition phase, we propose an improvement of the well-known two-pass strategy: by using a non-normalized acoustic model for the first recognition pass instead of a normalized model, lower error rates are obtained. In recognition tests, this method is compared with a fast variant of VTN. The two-pass strategy is an efficient method, but it is suboptimal because the scale factor and the word sequence are determined sequentially. We found that for telephone digit string recognition this suboptimality reduces the VTN gain in recognition performance by 30% relative. In summary, on the German spontaneous speech task Verbmobil, the WSJ task and the German telephone digit string corpus SieTill, the proposed methods for VTN reduce the error rates significantly</title><text>This paper presents methods for speaker adaptive modeling using vocal tract</text><keywords>speaker adaptive modeling;vocal tract normalization;databases;training method;single-density acoustic models;HMM state;training speakers;single Gaussian densities;training results;two-pass strategy;word sequence;telephone digit string recognition;German spontaneous speech task;WSJ task;German telephone digit string corpus;SieTill</keywords></doc>

Twenty solitary lung nodules smaller than 30 mm in diameter, including 10 lung cancers and 10 benign nodules, were used. The nodules were grouped subjectively according to their subtlety. For nonnodular cases, 20 nodules without perceptible interval changes were selected. All chest radiographs were obtained by using a computed radiographic system, and temporal subtraction images were produced by using a program developed at the University of Chicago. The effect of the temporal subtraction image was evaluated by using an observer performance study, with use of receiver operating characteristic analysis. Observer performance with temporal subtraction images was substantially improved (A/sub z/ = 0.980 and 0.958), as compared with that without temporal subtraction images (A/sub z/ = 0.920 and 0.825) for the certified radiologists and radiology residents, respectively.

However, when each partner of a couple exists in the same cultures, they also have an opportunity for deeply shared understanding and empathy, simply because each understands at a deep level the culture in which the other works. I explore this notion. A couple has what we call the "two-body problem" when both are professionals who are qualified for a kind of position that is relatively rare and who are very selective about the positions that they accept. For example, there are relatively scant numbers of jobs as a computer science professor-at any level. An individual considering an academic job may only be interested in research universities, or in teaching universities, restricting the choice of open positions substantially. The classic two-body "problem" arises when one partner wants to accept a new position that requires geographical relocation. Then, the other partner also needs to find a new position.

<doc><title>Induced-shear piezoelectric actuators for rotor blade trailing edge flaps reducing unwanted helicopter noise and vibration. One of the most promising active rotorcraft vibration control systems is an active trailing edge flap. In this paper, an induced-shear piezoelectric tube actuator is used in conjunction with a simple lever-cusp hinge amplification device to generate a useful combination of trailing edge flap deflections and hinge moments. A finite-element model of the actuator tube and trailing edge flap (including aerodynamic and inertial loading) was used to guide the design of the actuator-flap system. A full-scale induced shear tube actuator flap system was fabricated and bench top testing was conducted to validate the analysis. Hinge moments corresponding to various rotor speeds were applied to the actuator using mechanical springs. The testing demonstrated that for an applied electric field of 3 kV cm/sup -1/ the tube actuator deflected a representative full-scale 12 inch flap +or-2.8 degrees at 0 rpm and +or-1.4 degrees for a hinge moment simulating a 400 rpm condition. The per cent error between the predicted and experimental full-scale flap deflections ranged from 4% (low rpm) to 12.5% (large rpm). Increasing the electric field to 4 kV cm/sup -1/ results in +or-2.5 degrees flap deflection at a rotation speed of 400 rpm, according to the design analysis. A trade study was conducted to compare the performance of the piezoelectric tube actuator to the state of the art in trailing edge flap actuators and indicated that the induced-shear tube actuator shows promise as a trailing edge flap actuator</title><text>Much of the current rotorcraft research is focused on improving performance by</text><keywords>rotorcraft;helicopter noise;vibration control;active trailing edge flap;lever-cusp hinge amplification device;finite-element model;inertial loading;design;shear tube actuator flap;bench top testing;piezoelectric tube actuator;induced-shear tube actuator</keywords></doc>

Given some task, we compute a set of probability densities on continuous state and action and time. From these densities we derive an optimal policy such that for all states the most likely action maximizes the probability of reaching a predefined goal state. Liouville's conservation theorem tells us that the conditional density at time t, state s, and action a must equal the density at t + dt, s + ds, a + da. Discretization yields a linear system that can be solved directly and whose solution corresponds to an optimal policy.

The problem of reachability in such nets consists in finding a sequence of transitions that leads from the initial marking of a given contextual net to a given goal marking. The solution to this problem that is presented in this paper consists in constructing a finite complete prefix of the unfolding of the given contextual net, that is a finite prefix in which all the markings that are reachable from the initial marking are present, and in searching in each branch of this prefix for the goal marking by solving an appropriate linear programming problem</title><text>Contextual nets, or Petri nets with read arcs, are models of concurrent systems</text><keywords>Petri nets;concurrent systems;context dependent actions;finite prefix;goal marking;linear programming</keywords></doc>
<doc><title>Anatomy of the coupling query in a Web warehouse warehouse, it is imperative to harness relevant documents from the Web. In this paper, we describe a query mechanism called coupling query to glean relevant Web data in the context of our Web warehousing system called Warehouse Of Web Data (WHOWEDA). A coupling query may be used for querying both HTML and XML documents. Important features of our query mechanism are the ability to query metadata, content, internal and external (hyperlink) structure of Web documents based on partial knowledge, ability to express constraints on tag attributes and tagless segment of data, ability to express conjunctive as well as disjunctive query conditions compactly, ability to control execution of a Web query and preservation of the topological structure of hyperlinked documents in the query results. We also discuss how to formulate a query graphically and in textual form using a coupling graph and coupling text, respectively</title><text>To populate a data warehouse specifically designed for Web data, i.e. Web</text><keywords>coupling query;Web warehouse;data warehouse;Warehouse Of Web Data;XML documents;metadata;content;Web documents;partial knowledge;tag attributes;tagless segment;disjunctive query conditions;topological structure;hyperlinked documents;coupling text</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>Achieving competitive capabilities in e-services can business performance of e-service companies be improved in today's knowledge-based economy? These research questions are the subject of the paper. We propose a model that links the e-service company's knowledge-based competencies with their competitive capabilities. Drawing from the current literature, our analysis suggests that services that strategically build a portfolio of knowledge-based competencies, namely human capital, structural capital, and absorptive capacity have more operations-based options, than their counterparts who are less apt to invest. We assume that the combinative capabilities of service quality, delivery, flexibility, and cost are determined by the investment in intellectual capital. Arguably, with the advent of the Internet, different operating models (e.g., bricks-and-mortar, clicks-and-mortar, or pure dot-com) have different strategic imperatives in terms of knowledge-based competencies. Thus, the new e-operations paradigm can be viewed as a configuration of knowledge-based competencies and capabilities</title><text>What implications does the Internet have for service operations strategy?

Rapidly approaching now is the trend for next-generation CMMs. However, the increases in measuring velocity of CMM applications are limited by dynamic errors that occur in CMMs. In this paper a systematic approach for modeling the dynamic errors of a touch-trigger probe CMM is developed through theoretical analysis and experimental study. An overall analysis of the dynamic errors of CMMs is conducted, with weak components of the CMM identified by a laser interferometer. The probing process, as conducted with a touch-trigger probe, is analyzed. The dynamic errors are measured, modeled, and predicted using neural networks. The results indicate that, using this mode, it is possible to compensate for the dynamic errors of CMMs</title><text>Coordinate measuring machines (CMMs) are already widely utilized as measuring</text><keywords>coordinate measuring machines;dynamic errors;touch-trigger probe;laser interferometer;neural networks;manufacturing industry;compensation</keywords></doc>
<doc><title>A model of periodic oscillation for genetic regulatory systems gene-protein systems with a simple nonlinear model and on analyzing effects of time delay on the stability of oscillations. Our main model of genetic regulation comprises of a two-gene system with an autoregulatory feedback loop. We exploit multiple time scales and hysteretic properties of the model to construct periodic oscillations with jumping dynamics and analyze the possible mechanism according to the singular perturbation theory. As shown in this paper, periodic oscillations are mainly generated by nonlinearly negative and positive feedback loops in gene regulatory systems, whereas the jumping dynamics is generally caused by time scale differences among biochemical reactions. This simple model may actually act as a genetic oscillator or switch in gene-protein networks because the dynamics are robust for parameter perturbations or environment variations. We also explore effects of time delay on the stability of the dynamics, showing that the time delay generally increases the stability region of the oscillations, thereby making the oscillations robust to parameter changes. Two examples are also provided to numerically demonstrate our theoretical results</title><text>In this paper, we focus on modeling and explaining periodic oscillations in</text><keywords>modeling;periodic oscillations;gene-protein systems;nonlinear model;time delay;genetic regulation;two-gene system;autoregulatory feedback loop;hysteretic properties;jumping dynamics;singular perturbation theory;genetic regulatory system;biochemical reactions;stability region</keywords></doc>

The model has an exactly solvable statistic: the critical exponents and scaling functions of the SAT/UNSAT transition are calculable at zero temperature, with no need of replicas, also with exact finite-size corrections. We also introduce an exact duality of the model, and show an analogy of thermodynamic properties with the random energy model of disordered spin system theory.

<doc><title>Data assimilation of local model error forecasts in a deterministic model Kalman filter type, which provide an improved estimate of the state of a system up to the current time level, based on actual measurements. From a forecasting viewpoint, this corresponds to an updating of the initial conditions. The standard forecasting procedure is to then run the model uncorrected into the future, driven by predicted boundary and forcing conditions. The problem with this methodology is that the updated initial conditions quickly 'wash-out', thus, after a certain forecast horizon the model predictions are no better than from an initially uncorrected model. This study demonstrates that through the assimilation of error forecasts (in the present case made using so-called local models) entire model domains can be corrected for extended forecast horizons (i.e. long after updated initial conditions have become washed-out), thus demonstrating significant improvements over the conventional methodology. Some alternate uses of local models are also explored for the re-distribution of error forecasts over the entire model domain, which are then compared with more conventional Kalman filter type schemes</title><text>One of the most popular data assimilation techniques in use today are of the</text><keywords>data assimilation;local model error forecasts;deterministic model;Kalman filter;forcing conditions;forecast horizon</keywords></doc>

For a structured modelling, RBF-like static neural networks are used in order to represent and adapt all model parameters with their non-linear dependences on the joint positions. The neural architecture is hierarchically organised to reach optimal adjustment to structural a priori-knowledge about the identification problem. The model structure is substantially simplified by general system analysis independent of robot type. But also a lot of specific features of the utilised experimental robot are taken into account. A fixed, grid based neuron placement together with application of B-spline polynomial basis functions is utilised favourably for a very effective recursive implementation of the neural architecture.

<doc><title>Application of an internally consistent material model to determine the effect of tool edge geometry in orthogonal machining measured in metal cutting. Two experimental methods have been suggested in the past to extract the ploughing (non-cutting) component from the total measured force: (1) the extrapolation approach, and (2) the dwell force technique. This study reports the behavior of zinc during orthogonal machining using tools of controlled edge radius. Applications of both the extrapolation and dwell approaches show that neither produces an analysis that yields a material response consistent with the known behavior of zinc. Further analysis shows that the edge geometry modifies the shear zone of the material and thereby modifies the forces. When analyzed this way, the measured force data yield the expected material response without requiring recourse to an additional ploughing component</title><text>It is well known that the edge geometry of a cutting tool affects the forces</text><keywords>tool edge geometry;cutting tool;metal cutting;ploughing component;extrapolation;dwell force;zinc;edge geometry;orthogonal machining</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>A comparison of high-power converter topologies for the implementation of FACTS controllers flexible AC transmission system (FACTS) controllers: three multilevel topologies (multipoint clamped (MPC), chain, and nested cell) and the well-established multipulse topology. In keeping with the need to implement very-high-power inverters, switching frequency is restricted to line frequency. The study addresses device count, DC filter ratings, restrictions on voltage control, active power transfer through the DC link, and balancing of DC-link voltages. Emphasis is placed on capacitor sizing because of its impact on the cost and size of the FACTS controller. A method for the dimensioning the DC capacitor filter is presented. It is found that the chain converter is attractive for the implementation of a static compensator or a static synchronous series compensator. The MPC converter is attractive for the implementation of a unified power flow controller or an interline power flow controller, but a special arrangement is required to overcome the limitations on voltage control</title><text>This paper compares four power converter topologies for the implementation of</text><keywords>FACTS controllers;multilevel topologies;multipulse topology;inverters;switching frequency;device count;DC filter ratings;unified power flow controller;static compensator;static synchronous series compensator</keywords></doc>

From the point of view of media control there are several problems. Italy has democratic institutions and freedom of speech, but there is an alarming concentration in the control of mainstream media (especially broadcast).

<doc><title>Computer aided classification of masses in ultrasonic mammography classification of masses in ultrasonic B-mode images as benign or malignant. The classification was performed using the normalized parameters of the Nakagami distribution at a single region of interest at the site of the mass. A combination of normalized Nakagami parameters from two different images of a mass was undertaken to improve the performance of classification. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis showed that such an approach resulted in an area of 0.83 under the ROC curve. The aim of the work described in this paper is to see whether a feature describing the characteristic of the boundary can be extracted and combined with the Nakagami parameter to further improve the performance of classification. The combination of the features has been performed using a weighted summation. Results indicate a 10% improvement in specificity at a sensitivity of 96% after combining the information at the site and at the boundary. Moreover, the technique requires minimal clinical intervention and has a performance that reaches that of the trained radiologist. It is hence suggested that this technique may be utilized in practice to characterize breast masses</title><text>Frequency compounding was recently investigated for computer aided</text><keywords>ultrasonic mammography;breast masses;computer aided classification;frequency compounding;ultrasonic B-mode images;benign;malignant;normalized parameters;Nakagami distribution;single region of interest;normalized Nakagami parameters;receiver operating characteristic;ROC curve;weighted summation;specificity;sensitivity;minimal clinical intervention</keywords></doc>

In the first scheduling scheme, the values of the state feedback and observer gain matrices are interpolated between the fixed-point designs as a function of aircraft speed. In the second approach, the control signals produced by the different fixed-point controllers are blended, allowing a significant reduction in the order of the scheduled controllers.

One of such applications is the modeling of distributed design or manufacturing processes which can link up various designs or manufacturing processes to form a virtual consortium on a global basis. This paper proposes a novel knowledge intensive multi-agent cooperative/collaborative framework for concurrent intelligent design and assembly planning, which integrates product design, design for assembly, assembly planning, assembly system design, and assembly simulation subjected to econo-technical evaluations. An AI protocol based method is proposed to facilitate the integration of intelligent agents for assembly design, planning, evaluation and simulation processes. A unified class of knowledge intensive Petri nets is defined using the OO knowledge-based Petri net approach and used as an AI protocol for handling both the integration and the negotiation problems among multi-agents. The detailed cooperative/collaborative mechanism and algorithms are given based on the knowledge object cooperation formalisms. As such, the assembly-oriented design system can easily be implemented under the multi-agent-based knowledge-intensive Petri net framework with concurrent integration of multiple cooperative knowledge sources and software. Thus, product design and assembly planning can be carried out simultaneously and intelligently in an entirely computer-aided concurrent design and assembly planning system</title><text>Multi-agent modeling has emerged as a promising discipline for dealing with the</text><keywords>knowledge intensive multi-agent framework;decision support;distributed information system applications;distributed design;virtual consortium;concurrent intelligent design;assembly planning;product design;design for assembly;assembly simulation;AI protocol;knowledge intensive Petri nets;knowledge object cooperation</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>Approximate confidence intervals for one proportion and difference of two proportions of two proportions is a routine exercise in daily data analysis. The best-known method is the Wald interval based on the asymptotic normal approximation to the distribution of the observed sample proportion, though it is known to have bad performance for small to medium sample sizes. Agresti et al. (1998, 2000) proposed an Adding-4 method: 4 pseudo-observations are added with 2 successes and 2 failures and then the resulting (pseudo-)sample proportion is used. The method is simple and performs extremely well. Here we propose an approximate method based on a t-approximation that takes account of the uncertainty in estimating the variance of the observed (pseudo-)sample proportion. It follows the same line of using a t-test, rather than z-test, in testing the mean of a normal distribution with an unknown variance. For some circumstances our proposed method has a higher coverage probability than the Adding-4 method</title><text>Constructing a confidence interval for a binomial proportion or the difference</text><keywords>approximate confidence intervals;binomial proportion;difference of two proportions;data analysis;t-approximation;uncertainty;t-test;normal distribution;coverage probability</keywords></doc>

The theorem, while often very useful, is incomplete in the sense that it does not explicitly specify the family of maps for which the condition is met.

<doc><title>Modular and visual specification of hybrid systems: an introduction to HyCharts hybrid systems, because specifications of such systems usually have to be discussed between engineers from a number of different disciplines. Modularity is vital for hybrid systems not only because it allows to handle large systems, but also because it permits to think in terms of components, which is familiar to engineers. Based on two different interpretations for hierarchic graphs and on a clear hybrid computation model, we develop HyCharts. HyCharts consist of two modular visual formalisms, one for the specification of the architecture and one for the specification of the behavior of hybrid systems. The operators on hierarchic graphs enable us to give a surprisingly simple denotational semantics for many concepts known from statechart-like formalisms. Due to a very general composition operator, HyCharts can easily be composed with description techniques from other engineering disciplines. Such heterogeneous system specifications seem to be particularly appropriate for hybrid systems because of their interdisciplinary character</title><text>Visual description techniques are particularly important for the design of</text><keywords>visual specification;hybrid systems;HyCharts;visual description techniques;components;hierarchic graphs;hybrid computation model;denotational semantics;heterogeneous system specifications</keywords></doc>

The study of the hardware structure of the multi-view image processing has not been accomplished. The proposed multi-view images decoder operates in a three stage pipelined manner and extracts the depth of the pixels of the decoded image every clock. The multi-view images decoder consists of three modules, Node selector which transfers the value of the nodes repeatedly and Depth Extractor which extracts the depth of each pixel from the four values of the nodes and Affine Transformer which generates the projecting position on the image plane from the values of the pixels and the specified viewpoint.

<doc><title>New approach to standing phase angle reduction for power system restoration between two buses before closing circuit breakers to connect a line between them. These angles may occur across a tie line between two systems or between two connected subsystems within a system. In case of large standing phase angle (SPA) difference the synchro-check relay does not allow closing of the breaker for this line. Therefore, this excessive SPA has to be reduced before attempting to connect the line. In this paper, a new and fast method for reducing SPA is presented. For this purpose, the standing phase angle difference between two specific buses is represented in terms of sensitivity factors associated with the change in active power generations and consumption at the buses. Then, the proposed method reschedule generation of selected units or shed load of selected buses to reduce excessive SPA difference between two buses based on sensitivity factors</title><text>During power system restoration, it is necessary to check the phase angle</text><keywords>power system restoration;sensitivity factors</keywords></doc>

The VSC strategy is employed to track the crank angular position and speed, while the stabilizer design is involved to suppress the flexible vibrations simultaneously. From the theoretical impact consideration, three approaches including the generalized momentum balance (GMB), the continuous force model (CFM), and the CFM associated with the effective mass compensation EMC are adopted, and are derived on the basis of the energy and impulse-momentum conservations.

<doc><title>Dynamics of the firing probability of noisy integrate-and-fire neurons activity, which acts as a major source of noise. We investigate the effects of the noise filtering by synapses with various levels of realism on integrate-and-fire neuron dynamics. The noise input is modeled by white (for instantaneous synapses) or colored (for synapses with a finite relaxation time) noise. Analytical results for the modulation of firing probability in response to an oscillatory input current are obtained by expanding a Fokker-Planck equation for small parameters of the problem-when both the amplitude of the modulation is small compared to the background firing rate and the synaptic time constant is small compared to the membrane time constant. We report the detailed calculations showing that if a synaptic decay time constant is included in the synaptic current model, the firing-rate modulation of the neuron due to an oscillatory input remains finite in the high-frequency limit with no phase lag. In addition, we characterize the low-frequency behavior and the behavior of the high-frequency limit for intermediate decay times. We also characterize the effects of introducing a rise time to the synaptic currents and the presence of several synaptic receptors with different kinetics. In both cases, we determine, using numerical simulations, an effective decay time constant that describes the neuronal response completely</title><text>Cortical neurons in vivo undergo a continuous bombardment due to synaptic</text><keywords>firing probability;noisy integrate-and-fire neurons;cortical neurons;noise filtering;Fokker-Planck equation;synaptic time constant;membrane time constant;phase lag;synaptic receptors;numerical simulation</keywords></doc>

The Golla-Hughes-McTavish method is employed to capture the viscoelastic material behavior in a time domain analysis. The parametric study includes the different control gains as well as geometric parameters related to the active constrained layer damping (ACLD) treatment. Comparisons are made among several ACLD models, the passive constrained model and the active damping model. The results obtained here reiterate that ACLD is somewhat better for vibration suppression than either the purely passive or the active system and provides higher structural damping with less control gain when compared to the purely active system. Since the ACLD performance can be reduced by the viscoelastic layer, the design of the ACLD model must be given a careful consideration in order to optimize the effect of passive damping</title><text>A three-dimensional finite-element closed-loop model has been developed to</text><keywords>three-dimensional finite-element closed-loop model;Golla-Hughes-McTavish method;viscoelastic material;time domain analysis;active constrained layer damping;ACLD models;passive constrained model;active damping model;passive damping;vibration suppression;structural damping;viscoelastic layer</keywords></doc>

We describe an ideal, fully scalable protocol for these applications that we call a digital fountain. A digital fountain allows any number of heterogeneous receivers to acquire content with optimal efficiency at times of their choosing. Moreover, no feedback channels are needed to ensure reliable delivery, even in the face of high loss rates. We develop a protocol that closely approximates a digital fountain using two new classes of erasure codes that for large block sizes are orders of magnitude faster than standard erasure codes.

<doc><title>Towards strong stability of concurrent repetitive processes sharing resources repetitive processes sharing common resources. Steady-state behaviour of the system with m cyclic processes utilising a resource with the mutual exclusion is considered. Based on a recurrent equations framework necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of maximal performance steady-state are presented. It was shown that if the conditions hold then the m-process system is marginally stable, i.e., a steady-state of the system depends on the perturbations. The problem of finding the relative positions of the processes leading to waiting-free (maximal efficiency) steady-states of the system is formulated as a constraint logic programming problem. An example illustrating the solving of the problem for a 3-process system using object-oriented, constraint logic programming language Oz is presented. A condition sufficient for strong stability of the m-process system is given. When the condition holds then for any initial phases of the processes a waiting-free steady-state will be reached</title><text>The paper presents a method for design of stability conditions of concurrent,</text><keywords>strong stability;concurrent repetitive processes;common resources;steady-state behaviour;cyclic processes;mutual exclusion;recurrent equations framework;necessary and sufficient conditions;maximal performance steady-state;waiting-free steady-states;constraint logic programming;3-process system</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>A three-source model for the calculation of head scatter factors issue, especially for intensity modulated radiation therapy, where the segmented fields are often very irregular and much less than the collimator jaw settings. In this work, we report an S/sub c/ calculation algorithm for symmetric, asymmetric, and irregular open fields shaped by the tertiary collimator (a multileaf collimator or blocks) at different source-to-chamber distance. The algorithm was based on a three-source model, in which the photon radiation to the point of calculation was treated as if it originated from three effective sources: one source for the primary photons from the target and two extra-focal photon sources for the scattered photons from the primary collimator and the flattening filter, respectively. The field mapping method proposed by Kim et al. [Phys. Med. Biol. 43, 1593-1604 (1998)] was extended to two extra-focal source planes and the scatter contributions were integrated over the projected areas (determined by the detector's eye view) in the three source planes considering the source intensity distributions. The algorithm was implemented using Microsoft Visual C/C++ in the MS Windows environment. The only input data required were head scatter factors for symmetric square fields, which are normally acquired during machine commissioning. A large number of different fields were used to evaluate the algorithm and the results were compared with measurements. We found that most of the calculated S/sub c/'s agreed with the measured values to within 0.4%. The algorithm can also be easily applied to deal with irregular fields shaped by a multileaf collimator that replaces the upper or lower collimator jaws</title><text>Accurate determination of the head scatter factor S/sub c/ is an important</text><keywords>three-source model;head scatter factors;intensity modulated radiation therapy;segmented fields;collimator jaw settings;calculation algorithm;symmetric;fields;asymmetric;fields;irregular open fields;tertiary collimator;multileaf collimator;blocks;source-to-chamber distance;photon radiation;target;extra-focal photon sources;scattered photons;primary collimator;flattening filter;field mapping method;extra-focal source planes;source intensity distributions;MS Windows environment;input data;symmetric square fields;machine commissioning;lower collimator jaws</keywords></doc>

Batching customers' requests is either client-initiated or server-initiated. Most advanced client-initiated video multicasts are implemented by patching. Periodic broadcast, a typical server-initiated approach, can be entirety-based or segment-based. This paper focuses on the performance of the VoD service for popular videos. First, we analyze the limitation of conventional patching when the customer request rate is high. Then, by combining the advantages of each of the two broadcast schemes, we propose a hybrid broadcast scheme for popular videos, which not only lowers the service latency but also improves clients' interactivity by using an active buffering technique. This is shown to be a good compromise for both lowering service latency and improving the VCR-like interactivity</title><text>Multicast offers an efficient means of distributing video contents/programs to</text><keywords>interactivity;video-on-demand;multicast;conventional patching;customer request rate;hybrid broadcast scheme</keywords></doc>
<doc><title>Scalable secure group communication over IP multicast group communications Internet protocol multicast. We show that our scheme incurs constant processing, message, and storage overhead for a rekey operation when a single member joins or leaves the group, and logarithmic overhead for bulk simultaneous changes to the group membership. These bounds hold even when group dynamics are not known a priori. Our rekeying algorithm requires a particular clustering of the members of the secure multicast group. We describe a protocol to achieve such clustering and show that it is feasible to efficiently cluster members over realistic Internet-like topologies. We evaluate the overhead of our own rekeying scheme and also of previously published schemes via simulation over an Internet topology map containing over 280 000 routers. Through analysis and detailed simulations, we show that this rekeying scheme performs better than previous schemes for a single change to group membership. Further, for bulk group changes, our algorithm outperforms all previously known schemes by several orders of magnitude in terms of actual bandwidth usage, processing costs, and storage requirements</title><text>We introduce and analyze a scalable rekeying scheme for implementing secure</text><keywords>scalable secure group communication;IP multicast;Internet protocol multicast;storage overhead;logarithmic overhead;group membership;group dynamics;rekeying algorithm;secure multicast group;Internet-like topologies;overhead;simulation;Internet topology map;bandwidth usage;processing costs;storage requirements</keywords></doc>

Therefore, the proposed AC chopper gives high efficiency and reliability. The output voltage of the line conditioner is controlled using a fast sensing technique of the output voltage.

A multitemporal analysis of land use in certain areas of the Colombian Caribbean Coast is described. It mainly focuses on environmental impacts caused by anthropogenic activities, such as deforestation of mangroves due to shrimp farming. Selection of sensitive areas, percentage of destroyed mangroves, possible endangered areas, etc., are some of the results of this analysis. Recommendations for a coastal management plan in the area have also resulted from this analysis. Some other consequences of the deforestation of mangroves in the coastal zone and the construction of shrimp ponds are also analyzed, such as the increase of erosion problems in these areas and water pollution, among others. The increase of erosion in these areas has also changed part of their morphology, which has been studied by the analysis of SPOT images in previous years. A serious concern exists about the future of these areas. For this reason new techniques like satellite images (SPOT) have been applied with good results, leading to more effective control and coastal management in the area. The use of SPOT images to study changes of the land use of the area is a useful technique to determine patterns of human activities and suggest solutions for severe problems in these areas</title><text>Modern techniques such as remote sensing have been one of the main factors</text><keywords>coastal zone management;SPOT images;remote sensing;multitemporal analysis;land use;Colombian Caribbean Coast;anthropogenic activities;shrimp farming;endangered areas;erosion problems;water pollution;satellite images;human activities;shrimp ponds</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>Distributed servers approach for large-scale secure multicast (i.e., a new member cannot decrypt the multicast data sent before its joining and a former member cannot decrypt the data sent after its leaving), the data encryption key has to be changed whenever a user joins or leaves the system. Such a change has to be made known to all the current users. The bandwidth used for such re-key messaging can be high when the user pool is large. We propose a distributed servers approach to minimize the overall system bandwidth (and complexity) by splitting the user pool into multiple groups each served by a (logical) server. After presenting an analytic model for the system based on a hierarchical key tree, we show that there is an optimal number of servers to achieve minimum system bandwidth. As the underlying user traffic fluctuates, we propose a simple dynamic scheme with low overhead where a physical server adaptively splits and merges its traffic into multiple groups each served by a logical server so as to minimize its total bandwidth. Our results show that a distributed servers approach is able to substantially reduce the total bandwidth required as compared with the traditional single-server approach, especially for those applications with a large user pool, short holding time, and relatively low bandwidth of a data stream, as in the Internet stock quote applications</title><text>In order to offer backward and forward secrecy for multicast applications</text><keywords>distributed servers;large-scale secure multicast;forward secrecy;multicast applications;data encryption key;re-key messaging;system bandwidth;hierarchical key tree;user traffic;short holding time;Internet stock quote applications</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>Noise and the PSTH response to current transients: II. Integrate-and-fire model with slow recovery and application to motoneuron data the integrate-and-fire model is presented that qualitatively reproduces firing rates and membrane trajectories of motoneurons. The description is based on the spike-response model and includes three different time constants: the passive membrane time constant, a recovery time of the input conductance after each spike, and a time constant of the spike afterpotential. The effect of stochastic background input on the peristimulus time histogram (PSTH) response to spike input is calculated analytically. Model results are compared with the experimental data of Poliakov et al. (1996). The linearized theory shows that the PSTH response to an input spike is proportional to a filtered version of the postsynaptic potential generated by the input spike. The shape of the filter depends on the background activity. The full nonlinear theory is in close agreement with simulated PSTH data</title><text>For pt.I see ibid., vol.11, no.2 , p.135-151( 2001).

<doc><title>Quantum retrodiction in open systems events given a measurement event. This theory has been studied for some time but mainly as an interesting concept associated with time asymmetry in quantum mechanics. Recent interest in quantum communications and cryptography, however, has provided retrodiction with a potential practical application. For this purpose quantum retrodiction in open systems should be more relevant than in closed systems isolated from the environment. In this paper we study retrodiction in open systems and develop a general master equation for the backward time evolution of the measured state, which can be used for calculating preparation probabilities. We solve the master equation, by way of example, for the driven two-level atom coupled to the electromagnetic field</title><text>Quantum retrodiction involves finding the probabilities for various preparation</text><keywords>quantum retrodiction;probabilities;measurement event;time asymmetry;quantum mechanics;quantum communications;cryptography;backward time evolution;preparation probabilities;open systems</keywords></doc>

Today, the company supplies electricity to some 1.7 million inhabitants via 285000 connections. During 1999, the year the energy market was started in Germany, HEW needed to operate and maintain a safe and reliable network cheaply. The development and implementation of a distribution management system (DMS) is key to the success of HEW. HEW's strategy was to obtain efficient new software for network management that also offered a good platform for future applications. Following a pilot and prequalification phase, HEW invited several companies to process the requirements catalog and to submit a detailed tender. The network information management system, Xpower, developed by Tekla Oyj, successfully passed HEW's test program and satisfied all the performance and system capacity requirements. The system met all HEW's conditions by presenting the reality of a network with the attributes of the operating resources.

<doc><title>How does attitude impact IT implementation: a study of small business owners among small business owners appears to be a key factor in achieving high quality IT implementations. In an effort to extend this stream of research, we conducted case studies with small business owners and learned that high quality IT implementations resulted with owners who had positive or negative attitudes toward IT, but not with owners who had uncertain attitudes. Owners with apolar attitude, either positive or negative, all took action to temper the uncertainty and risk surrounding the use of new IT in their organization. In contrast, owners with uncertain attitudes did not make mitigating attempts to reduce uncertainty and risk. A consistent finding among those with high quality IT implementations was an entrepreneurial, or shared, management style. It is proposed, based on case study data, that small business owners with an uncertain attitude towards IT might experience higher quality IT results in their organizations through practicing a more entrepreneurial, or shared, management style.

<doc><title>A large deviations analysis of the transient of a queue with many Markov fluid inputs: approximations and fast simulation by a large number of Markov fluid sources. We characterize the probability of overflow at time t, given the current buffer level and the number of sources in the on-state. After scaling buffer and bandwidth resources by the number of sources n, we can apply large deviations techniques. The transient overflow probability decays exponentially in n. In the case of exponential on/off sources, we derive an expression for the decay rate of the rare event probability under consideration. For general Markov fluid sources, we present a plausible conjecture. We also provide the "most likely path" from the initial state to overflow (at time t). Knowledge of the decay rate and the most likely path to overflow leads to (i) approximations of the transient overflow probability and (ii) efficient simulation methods of the rare event of buffer overflow. The simulation methods, based on importance sampling, give a huge speed-up compared to straightforward simulations. The approximations are of low computational complexity and are accurate, as verified by means of simulation experiments</title><text>This article analyzes the transient buffer content distribution of a queue fed</text><keywords>large deviations analysis;Markov fluid inputs;transient buffer content distribution;bandwidth resources;approximations;transient overflow probability;simulation methods;importance sampling;computational complexity</keywords></doc>

Continuous or steady state machining operations like orthogonal cutting are studied by modeling the heat transfer between the tool and chip at the tool-rake face contact zone. The shear energy created in the primary zone, the friction energy produced at the rake face-chip contact zone and the heat balance between the moving chip and stationary tool are considered. The temperature distribution is solved using the finite difference method. Later, the model is extended to milling where the cutting is interrupted and the chip thickness varies with time. The proposed model combines the steady-state temperature prediction in continuous machining with transient temperature evaluation in interrupted cutting operations where the chip and the process change in a discontinuous manner. The mathematical models and simulation results are in satisfactory agreement with experimental temperature measurements reported in the literature</title><text>A numerical model based on the finite difference method is presented to predict</text><keywords>continuous machining;interrupted machining;numerical model;finite difference method;time varying milling processes;orthogonal cutting;heat transfer;tool-rake face contact zone;shear energy;primary zone;friction energy;temperature distribution</keywords></doc>

Based on a nonlinear, distributed parameter model of the same process which was validated against experimental data of an existing, pilot-scale biological nutrient removal (BNR) activated sludge plant, we developed a state-space model with 154 state variables. A general algorithm for robustly reducing the nonlinear PDE model is presented and, based on an investigation of five state-of-the-art model-order reduction techniques, we are able to reduce the original model to a model with only 30 states without incurring pronounced modelling errors. The singular perturbation approximation balanced truncating technique is found to give the lowest modelling errors in low frequency ranges and hence is deemed most suitable for controller design and other real-time applications</title><text>This paper addresses robust model-order reduction of a high dimensional</text><keywords>complex biological processes;robust model-order reduction;state-space model;singular perturbation approximation balanced truncating technique;modelling errors;controller design</keywords></doc>
<doc><title>An augmented spatial digital tree algorithm for contact detection in computational mechanics detection approaches, and the alternating digital tree (ADT) algorithm in particular, a more efficient algorithm, termed the augmented spatial digital tree (ASDT) algorithm, is proposed in the present work. The ASDT algorithm adopts a different point representation scheme that uses only the lower comer vertex to represent a (hyper-)rectangle, with the upper comer vertex serving as the augmented information. Consequently, the ASDT algorithm can keep the working space the same as the original n-dimensional space and, in general, a much better balanced tree can be expected. This, together with the introduction of an additional bounding subregion for the rectangles associated with each tree node, makes it possible to significantly reduce the number of node visits in the region search, although each node visit may be slightly more expensive. Three examples arising in computational mechanics are presented to provide an assessment of the performance of the ASDT. The numerical results indicate that the ASDT is, at least, over 3.9 times faster than the ADT</title><text>Based on the understanding of existing spatial digital tree-based contact</text><keywords>augmented spatial digital tree algorithm;contact detection;computational mechanics;upper comer vertex</keywords></doc>

We also demonstrate how the formal theory can be used to obtain an existence and uniqueness theorem for smooth solutions of strongly hyperbolic systems and to estimate the drift off the constraints, if an underlying equation is numerically solved.

By constructing the optimal performance function as a relative measure of the total kinetic energy, strain energy and input energy of the system, only three design variables need to be considered to achieve a balance between the desired higher damping effect and lower input cost. Modal control analysis is used to interpret the effects of three energy weight factors on the damping ratios and modal voltages and it is shown that the modal damping effect will increase with the kinetic energy weight factor, approaching square root (2/2) as the strain energy weight factor increases and decrease with the input energy weight factor. Numerical results agree well with those from the modal control analysis. Since the control problem is simplified to three design variables only, the computational cost will be greatly reduced and a more accurate structural control analysis becomes more attractive for large systems</title><text>In this paper on finite element linear quadratic regulator (LQR) vibration</text><keywords>finite element linear quadratic regulator;vibration control;smart piezoelectric composite plates;total weighted energy;weighting matrices;optimal performance function;total kinetic energy;strain energy;damping effect;modal control analysis;damping ratios;strain energy weight factor;numerical results;computational cost;structural control analysis</keywords></doc>
<doc><title>Robust self-tuning PID controller for nonlinear systems nonlinear systems. The control system employs a preload relay (P_Relay) in series with a PID controller. The P_Relay ensures a high gain to yield a robust performance. However, it also incurs a chattering phenomenon. In this paper, instead of viewing the chattering as an undesirable yet inevitable feature, we use it as a naturally occurring signal for tuning and re-tuning the PID controller as the operating regime digresses. No other explicit input signal is required. Once the PID controller is tuned for a particular operating point, the relay may be disabled and chattering ceases correspondingly. However, it is invoked when there is a change in setpoint to another operating regime. In this way, the approach is also applicable to time-varying systems as the PID tuning can be continuous, based on the latest set of chattering characteristics. Analysis is provided on the stability properties of the control scheme. Simulation results for the level control of fluid in a spherical tank using the scheme are also presented</title><text>In this paper, we propose a robust self-tuning PID controller suitable for</text><keywords>nonlinear systems;robust self-tuning PID controller;preload relay;robust performance;chattering phenomenon;naturally occurring signal;operating regime;time-varying systems;stability properties;simulation results;spherical tank</keywords></doc>

An important aspect of portable performance is the behavior of the available HPF compilers. Ideally, a programmer may expect comparable performance between different HPF compilers, given the same program and the same machine. To test the performance portability between compilers, we have designed a special benchmark suite, called the TNO HPF benchmark suite. It consists of a set of HPF programs that test various aspects of efficient parallel code generation. The benchmark suite consists of a number of template programs that are used to generate test programs with different array sizes, alignments, distributions, and iteration spaces. It ranges from very simple assignments to more complex assignments such as triangular iteration spaces, convex iteration spaces, coupled subscripts, and indirection arrays. We have run the TNO HPF benchmark suite on three compilers: the PREPARE prototype compiler, the PGI-HPF compiler, and the GMD Adaptor HPF compiler. Results show performance differences that can be quite large (up to two orders of magnitude for the same test program). Closer inspection reveals that the origin of most of the differences in performance is due to differences in local enumeration and storage of distributed array elements</title><text>High-Performance Fortran (HPF) has been designed to provide portable</text><keywords>High-Performance Fortran;portable performance;distributed memory machines;HPF compilers;performance portability;benchmark suite</keywords></doc>

Eight sessions were conducted once a week. During each session, physiology was measured to give an objective measurement of improvement over the course of exposure therapy. In addition, self-report questionnaires, subjective ratings of anxiety (SUDs), and behavioral observations (included here as flying behavior before beginning treatment and at a three-month posttreatment followup) were included. In the analysis of results, the Chi-square test of behavioral observations based on a three-month posttreatment followup revealed a statistically significant difference in flying behavior between the groups [ chi /sup 2/(4)=19.41, p<0.001].

In this work, we address these difficulties and propose a two phase regression testing methodology. In phase 1, we explore control flow and data flow analysis issues of database applications. Then, we propose an impact analysis technique that is based on dependencies that exist among the components of database applications. This analysis leads to selecting test cases from the initial test suite for regression testing the modified application. In phase 2, further reduction in the regression test cases is performed by using reduction algorithms. We present two such algorithms. The Graph Walk algorithm walks through the control flow graph of database modules and selects a safe set of test cases to retest. The Call Graph Firewall algorithm uses a firewall for the inter procedural level. Finally, a maintenance environment for database applications is described.

In the high (low) relative saving version, the regular price of the target product is low (high). In both versions, the absolute value of the price reduction is the same as well as the total of regular prices of planned purchases. As first reported by Tversky and Kahneman (1981), findings show that the majority of people accept the price discount in the high-relative saving version whereas the minority do it in the low one. In Study 1, findings show that the previous preference reversal disappears when planned purchases are strongly related. Also, a previously unreported preference reversal is found. The majority of people accept the price discount when the products are weakly related whereas the minority accept when the products are strongly related. In Study 2, findings show that the classic preference reversal disappears as a function of the comparative price format. Also, another previously unreported preference reversal is found. When the offered price reduction relates to a low-priced product, people are more inclined to accept it with a control than a minimal comparative price format.

First, cerebrum segmentation from a midsagittal brain MR image is performed utilizing landmarks, anatomical information, and a connectivity-based threshold segmentation algorithm as previously reported. Recognizing that the cerebrum in laterally adjacent slices tends to have similar size and shape, we use the cerebrum segmentation result from the midsagittal brain MR image as a mask to guide cerebrum segmentation in adjacent lateral slices in an iterative fashion. This masking operation yields a masked image (preliminary cerebrum segmentation) for the next lateral slice, which may truncate brain region(s). Truncated regions are restored by first finding end points of their boundaries, by comparing the mask image and masked image boundaries, and then applying a connectivity-based algorithm. The resulting final extracted cerebrum image for this slice is then used as a mask for the next lateral slice. The algorithm yielded satisfactory fully automated cerebrum segmentations in three-dimensional sagittal brain MR images, and had performance superior to conventional edge detection algorithms for segmentation of cerebrum from 3D sagittal brain MR images</title><text>We present a fully automated cerebrum segmentation algorithm for full</text><keywords>fully automated cerebrum segmentation algorithm;midsagittal brain MR image;landmarks;anatomical information;connectivity-based threshold segmentation algorithm;laterally adjacent slices;masking operation;masked image boundaries;connectivity-based algorithm</keywords></doc>

This is an additional dimension of the generalized mosaic paradigm, which has demonstrated yielding high radiometric dynamic range images in a wide field of view, using a spatially varying density filter. The resulting mosaic represents the spectrum at each scene point. The image acquisition is as easy as in traditional image mosaics. We derive an efficient scene sampling rate, and use a registration method that accommodates the spatially varying properties of the filter. Using the data acquired by this method, we demonstrate scene rendering under different simulated illumination spectra. We are also able to infer information about the scene illumination.

If the technology or its creators aren't trustworthy and secure, chances are they aren't getting by Uncle Sam. Record companies and publishing houses tend to feel the same way. After all, security is just as important to a record executive as it is to a Navy commander. WAM!Net, a Wide-Area Media network (hence, the name) passes muster with both. The company, which employs about 320 employees around the world, has 15000 customers including the US Navy and a host of record labels, publishing companies, healthcare providers, and advertising agencies, all of whom use its network as a way to transport, store, and receive data.

<doc><title>Control of a heavy-duty robotic excavator using time delay control with integral sliding surface following problems: parameter variations in mechanical structures, various nonlinearities in hydraulic actuators and disturbance due to the contact with the ground. In addition, the more the size of robotic excavators increases, the more the length and mass of the excavator links; the more the parameters of a heavy-duty excavator vary. A time-delay control with switching action (TDCSA) using an integral sliding surface is proposed in this paper for the control of a 21-ton robotic excavator. Through analysis and experiments, we show that using an integral sliding surface for the switching action of TDCSA is better than using a PD-type sliding surface. The proposed controller is applied to straight-line motions of a 21-ton robotic excavator with a speed level at which skillful operators work. Experiments, which were designed for surfaces with various inclinations and over broad ranges of joint motions, show that the proposed controller exhibits good performance</title><text>The control of a robotic excavator is difficult from the standpoint of the</text><keywords>time-delay control;robotic excavator;integral sliding surface</keywords></doc>

In this paper we introduce a certain generalized priority policy and prove that the stability of this policy is algorithmically undecidable. We also prove that stability of a homogeneous random walk in L/sub +//sup d/ is undecidable. Finally, we show that the problem of computing a fluid limit of a queueing system or of a constrained homogeneous random walk is undecidable. To the best of our knowledge these are the first undecidability results in the area of stability of queueing systems and random walks in L/sub +//sup d/.

<doc><title>Process planning for reliable high-speed machining of moulds investigated. Forging dies and injection moulds, whether plastic or aluminium, have a complex surface geometry. In addition they are made of steels of hardness as much as 30 or even 50 HRC. Since 1995, high-speed machining has been much adopted by the die-making industry, which with this technology can reduce its use of Sinking Electrodischarge Machining (SEDM). EDM, in general, calls for longer machining times. The use of high-speed machining makes it necessary to redefine the preliminary stages of the process. In addition, it affects the methodology employed in the generation of NC programs, which requires the use of high-level CAM software. The aim is to generate error-free programs that make use of optimum cutting strategies in the interest of productivity and surface quality. The final result is a more reliable manufacturing process. There are two risks in the use of high-speed milling on hardened steels. One of these is tool breakage, which may be very costly and may furthermore entail marks on the workpiece. The other is collisions between the tool and the workpiece or fixtures, the result of which may be damage to the ceramic bearings in the spindles. in order to minimize these risks it is necessary that new control and optimization steps be included in the CAM methodology. There are three things that the firm adopting high-speed methods should do. It should redefine its process engineering, it should systematize access by its CAM programmers to high-speed knowhow, and it should take up the use of process simulation tools. In the latter case, it will be very advantageous to use tools for the estimation of cutting forces. The new work methods proposed in this article have made it possible to introduce high speed milling (HSM) into the die industry. Examples are given of how the technique has been applied with CAM programming re-engineered as here proposed, with an explanation of the novel features and the results</title><text>A method of generating NC programs for the high-speed milling of moulds is</text><keywords>moulds;reliable high-speed machining;process planning;NC programs;high-speed milling;forging dies;injection moulds;complex surface geometry;error-free programs;optimum cutting strategies;productivity;surface quality;hardened steels;tool breakage;ceramic bearings;CAM methodology;process simulation tools;cutting strategies</keywords></doc>

In the present approach, we use the Hamilton principle and a reduced bending stiffness method for the derivation of equations of motion. As a result, the in-plane displacements are not involved and the out-of-plane displacement of the laminate is the only quantity to be calculated. Therefore, the proposed method turns the twisting of a laminate with structural coupling into a simplified problem without losing its features. We give analytical solutions of the present model with harmonic excitation.

A new approach, named removing-boundary, is presented to generate piecewise-smooth subdivision surfaces through discarding the outmost quadrilaterals of the open meshes derived by each subdivision step. Then the approach is employed both to blend parametric bicubic B-spline surfaces and to fill n-sided holes. It is easy to produce piecewise-smooth subdivision surfaces with both convex and concave corners on the boundary, and limit surfaces are guaranteed to be C/sup 2/ continuous on the boundaries except for a few singular points by the removing-boundary approach. Thus the blending method is very efficient and the blending surface generated is of good effect</title><text>In this paper the problem of blending parametric surfaces using subdivision</text><keywords>subdivision surfaces;piecewise-smooth subdivision surfaces;quadrilaterals;parametric bicubic B-spline surfaces</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>Semantic data broadcast for a mobile environment based on dynamic and adaptive chunking information of high affinity to a large collection of mobile clients. A common problem of existing broadcast approaches is the lack of knowledge for a client to determine if all data items satisfying its query could be obtained from the broadcast. We therefore propose a semantic-based broadcast approach. A semantic descriptor is attached to each broadcast unit, called a data chunk. This semantic descriptor allows a client to determine if a query can be answered entirely based on broadcast items and, if needed, identify the precise definition of the remaining items in the form of a "supplementary" query. Data chunks can be of static or dynamic sizes and organized hierarchically. Their boundary can be determined on-the-fly, adaptive to the nature of client queries. We investigate different ways of organizing the data chunks over a broadcast channel to improve access performance. We introduce the data affinity index metric, which more accurately reflects client-perceived performance. A simulation model is built to evaluate our semantic-based broadcast schemes</title><text>Database broadcast is an effective and scalable approach to disseminate</text><keywords>semantic data broadcast;mobile clients;semantic descriptor;data chunking;data affinity index;adaptive chunking</keywords></doc>

JASE utilizes two important concepts in the field of distributed computing: the concept of services and remote programming with mobile agents. In JASE, mobile agents are used to support applications, and service interface agents are used to wrap services. Service inter-face agents can dynamically register their services in Service Server. Mobile agent locates a specific service interface agent by submitting requests to the Service Server with descriptions of required services. JASE uses XML to describe both service descriptions and the mobile agent's queries. JASE supports two kinds of communication facility: tuple space and asynchronous messages. In this paper, the design and implementation of JASE are described. An application shows the suitability and the effectiveness of the JASE and performance evaluation is also made.

The paper introduces several LWL algorithms that have been tested successfully in real-time learning of complex robot tasks. We discuss two major classes of LWL, memory-based LWL and purely incremental LWL that does not need to remember any data explicitly. In contrast to the traditional belief that LWL methods cannot work well in high-dimensional spaces, we provide new algorithms that have been tested on up to 90 dimensional learning problems. The applicability of our LWL algorithms is demonstrated in various robot learning examples, including the learning of devil-sticking, pole-balancing by a humanoid robot arm, and inverse-dynamics learning for a seven and a 30 degree-of-freedom robot. In all these examples, the application of our statistical neural networks techniques allowed either faster or more accurate acquisition of motor control than classical control engineering</title><text>Locally weighted learning (LWL) is a class of techniques from nonparametric</text><keywords>scalable techniques;nonparametric statistics;real time robot learning;locally weighted learning;training algorithms;complex phenomena;autonomous adaptive control;devil-sticking;pole-balancing;humanoid robot arm;inverse-dynamics learning;statistical neural networks techniques</keywords></doc>

The information provided by this system is essential to construction industry, including window and door builders; the glass, panel, board, and floor tile manufacturers; carpet venders; and building contractors for cost estimation and production control. As a result, the lead time for delivering the customized windowpanes, woodwork, floor tiles, and ceilings can be reduced. Applications of this system for measuring the shapes of window frames and floor plans are described and demonstrated. The measurement accuracy is evaluated and analyzed. Results have indicated that the measurement accuracy can be achieved within 4% of the measurement distance, for typical window designs and floor patterns required by major window manufacturers.

<doc><title>Permission grids: practical, error-bounded simplification guide almost any standard polygonal surface simplification algorithm into generating an approximation with a guaranteed geometric error bound. In particular, all points on the approximation are guaranteed to be within some user-specified distance from the original surface. Such bounds are notably absent from many current simplification methods, and are becoming increasingly important for applications in scientific computing and adaptive level of detail control. Conceptually simple, the permission grid defines a volume in which the approximation must lie, and does not permit the underlying simplification algorithm to generate approximations outside the volume. The permission grid makes three important, practical improvements over current error-bounded simplification methods. First, it works on arbitrary triangular models, handling all manners of mesh degeneracies gracefully. Further, the error tolerance may be easily expanded as simplification proceeds, allowing the construction of an error-bounded level of detail hierarchy with vertex correspondences among all levels of detail. And finally, the permission grid has a representation complexity independent of the size of the input model, and a small running time overhead, making it more practical and efficient than current methods with similar guarantees</title><text>We introduce the permission grid, a spatial occupancy grid which can be used to</text><keywords>permission grid;spatial occupancy grid;polygonal surface simplification algorithm;guaranteed geometric error bound;approximation;error-bounded simplification;user-specified distance;scientific computing;adaptive level of detail control;arbitrary triangular models;mesh degeneracies;error tolerance;vertex correspondences;representation complexity;running time overhead</keywords></doc>

Focuses on some of the reasons why the public business library is still needed as a service to businesses, even after the introduction of the Internet and considers the Library's changing role and the need to impress on all concerned, especially government, the continuing value of these services. Looks to the partnerships formed by the Library over the years and the ways in which these are expected to assist in realizing future opportunities, in particular, the fact that all public libraries in England gained free Internet access at the end of 2001. Offers some useful ideas about how the Library could develop, noting that SINTO, a Sheffield based information network formed in 1938 and originally a partnership between the public library, the two Sheffield universities and various leading steel companies of the time, is being examined as a model for future services in Leeds.

<doc><title>An efficient DIPIE algorithm for CAD of electrostatically actuated MEMS devices Efficient and accurate analysis tools that can capture these parameters for different design geometries, are therefore essential. Current simulation tools approach the pull-in state by iteratively adjusting the voltage applied across the actuator electrodes. The convergence rate of this scheme gradually deteriorates as the pull-in state is approached. Moreover, the convergence is inconsistent and requires many mesh and accuracy refinements to assure reliable predictions. As a result, the design procedure of electrostatically actuated MEMS devices can be time-consuming. In this paper a novel Displacement Iteration Pull-In Extraction (DIPIE) scheme is presented. The DIPIE scheme is shown to converge consistently and far more rapidly than the Voltage Iterations (VI) scheme (>100 times faster!). The DIPIE scheme requires separate mechanical and electrostatic field solvers. Therefore, it can be easily implemented in existing MOEMS CAD packages. Moreover, using the DIPIE scheme, the pull-in parameters extraction can be performed in a fully automated mode, and no user input for search bounds is required</title><text>Pull-in parameters are important properties of electrostatic actuators.</text><keywords>DIPIE algorithm;MOEMS CAD packages;electrostatically actuated MEMS devices;pull-in parameters;electrostatic actuators;design geometries;convergence rate;electrostatic field solver;displacement iteration</keywords></doc>
<doc><title>Efficient tracking of the cross-correlation coefficient signals, the performance can vary strongly over the repertoire that is used. This may be the case when the signals from the various channels are allowed to be strongly positively or negatively correlated. We propose and analyze a general formula for tracking the (time-dependent) correlation between two signals. Some special cases of this formula lead to classical results known from the literature, others are new. This formula is recursive in nature, and uses only the instantaneous values of the two signals, in a low-cost and low-complexity manner; in particular, there is no need to take square roots or to carry out divisions. Furthermore, this formula can be modified with respect to the occurrence of the two signals so as to further decrease the complexity, and increase ease of implementation. The latter modification comes at the expense that not the actual correlation is tracked, but, rather, a somewhat deformed version of it. To overcome this problem, we propose, for a number of instances of the tracking formula, a simple warping operation on the deformed correlation. Now we obtain, at least for sinusoidal signals, the correct value of the correlation coefficient. Special attention is paid to the convergence behavior of the algorithm for stationary signals and the dynamic behavior if there is a transition to another stationary state; the latter is considered to be important to study the tracking abilities to nonstationary signals. We illustrate tracking algorithm by using it for stereo music fragments, obtained from a number of digital audio recordings</title><text>In many (audio) processing algorithms, involving manipulation of discrete-time</text><keywords>efficient tracking;cross-correlation coefficient;audio processing algorithms;time-dependent correlation;warping operation;deformed correlation;sinusoidal signals;convergence behavior;stationary signals;dynamic behavior;stationary state;nonstationary signals;tracking algorithm;stereo music fragments;digital audio recording</keywords></doc>
<doc><title>Understanding Internet traffic streams: dragonflies and tortoises into flows through Internet links. We describe a method of measuring the size and lifetime of Internet streams, and use this method to characterize traffic distributions at two different sites. We find that although most streams (about 45 percent of them) are dragonflies, lasting less than 2 seconds, a significant number of streams have lifetimes of hours to days, and can carry a high proportion (50-60 percent) of the total bytes on a given link. We define tortoises as streams that last longer than 15 minutes. We point out that streams can be classified not only by lifetime (dragonflies and tortoises) but also by size (mice and elephants), and note that stream size and lifetime are independent dimensions. We submit that ISPs need to be aware of the distribution of Internet stream sizes, and the impact of the difference in behavior between short and long streams. In particular, any forwarding cache mechanisms in Internet routers must be able to cope with a high volume of short streams. In addition ISPs should realize that long-running streams can contribute a significant fraction of their packet and byte volumes-something they may not have allowed for when using traditional "flat rate user bandwidth consumption" approaches to provisioning and engineering</title><text>We present the concept of network traffic streams and the ways they aggregate</text><keywords>Internet traffic streams;dragonflies;tortoises;network traffic streams;traffic distributions;mice;elephants;ISP;forwarding cache mechanisms;Internet routers;long-running streams</keywords></doc>
<doc><title>A fuzzy-soft learning vector quantization for control chart pattern recognition a fuzzy-soft learning vector quantization, for control chart pattern recognition. Unnatural patterns in control charts mean that there are some unnatural causes for variations in statistical process control (SPC). Hence, control chart pattern recognition becomes more important in SPC. In order to detect effectively the patterns for the six main types of control charts, Pham and Oztemel (1994) described a class of pattern recognizers for control charts based on the learning vector quantization (LVQ) such as LVQ, LVQ2 and LVQ-X etc. In this paper, we propose a new supervised LVQ for control charts based on a fuzzy-soft competitive learning network. The proposed fuzzy-soft LVQ (FS-LVQ) uses a fuzzy relaxation technique and simultaneously updates all neurons. It can increase correct recognition accuracy and also decrease the learning time. Comparisons between LVQ, LVQ-X and FS-LVQ are made</title><text>This paper presents a supervised competitive learning network approach, called</text><keywords>control chart pattern recognition;fuzzy-soft learning vector quantization;supervised competitive learning network approach;unnatural patterns;statistical process control;SPC;supervised LVQ;fuzzy relaxation technique;correct recognition accuracy;learning time</keywords></doc>

Contrary to the programmable controller, an RNN-based sequential controller is based on a definite mathematical model rather than depending on the experience and trial and error techniques. The proposed controller is also more flexible because it is not limited by the restrictions of the finite state automata theory. Adequate guidelines of how to construct an RNN-based sequential controller are presented. These guidelines are applied to different case studies. The proposed controller is tested by simulations and real-time experiments. These tests prove the successfulness of the proposed controller performances. Theoretical as well as experimental results are presented and discussed indicating that the proposed design procedure using Elman's RNN can be effective in designing a sequential controller for event-based type manufacturing systems.

<doc><title>Ultrafast compound imaging for 2-D motion vector estimation: application to transient elastography motion vector at a very high frame rate with ultrasound. Its potential is experimentally demonstrated for transient elastography. But, beyond this application, it also could be promising for color flow and reflectivity imaging. To date, only axial displacements induced in human tissues by low-frequency vibrators were measured during transient elastography. The proposed technique allows us to follow both axial and lateral displacements during the shear wave propagation and thus should improve Young's modulus image reconstruction. The process is a combination of several ideas well-known in ultrasonic imaging: ultra-fast imaging, multisynthetic aperture beamforming, 1-D speckle tracking, and compound imaging. Classical beamforming in the transmit mode is replaced here by a single plane wave insonification increasing the frame rate by at least a factor of 128. The beamforming is achieved only in the receive mode on two independent subapertures. Comparison of successive frames by a classical 1-D speckle tracking algorithm allows estimation of displacements along two different directions linked to the subapertures beams. The variance of the estimates is finally improved by tilting the emitting plane wave at each insonification, thus allowing reception of successive decorrelated speckle patterns</title><text>This paper describes a new technique for two-dimensional (2-D) imaging of the</text><keywords>ultrafast compound imaging;transient elastography;high frame rate;ultrasound;reflectivity imaging;human tissues;axial displacements;lateral displacements;shear wave propagation;Young's modulus image reconstruction;ultrasonic imaging;multisynthetic aperture beamforming;decorrelated speckle patterns;single plane wave insonification</keywords></doc>

In an economic downturn it is a vital tool for pinpointing a business' most profitable customers, products, regions or channels, as well as uncovering the costs of individual business processes that may need to be improved in order to drive higher profit levels. Changes may be afoot in the ABM market, but Armstrong Laing Group CEO Mike Sherratt argues that businesses need specialists with an ABM focus to keep up with their requirements in such a climate. He looks at what benefits a `best-of-breed' ABM system can offer businesses and contends that businesses must choose carefully when going down the ABM route - and also ask themselves the question whether 'generalist' organisations will be able to deliver the best possible ABM solution</title><text>In today's stormy economic climate businesses need Activity Based Management</text><keywords>Armstrong Laing Group;activity based management</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>Modelling tomographic cone-beam projection data from a polyhedral phantom reconstruction accuracy in computed axial tomography. A circular source locus (equivalent to rotating specimen with a fixed source) provides insufficient data for 'exact' reconstruction in cone-beam transmission tomography, thus phantom data are useful for studying the consequent errors and also for investigating alternative scanning loci and reconstruction techniques. We present an algorithm that can compute phantom cone-beam projection data from a phantom comprising geometrically defined polyhedra. Each polyhedron is defined as a set of polygons enclosing a volume of fixed linear attenuation coefficient. The algorithm works by projecting each polygon in turn onto the modelled detector array, which accumulates the product of source to polygon intersection distance (for the rays intersecting each detector element), linear attenuation coefficient and sign of projected polygon area (indicating whether rays enter or exit the polyhedron at this face). The phantom data are rotated according to the projection angle, whilst the source location and detector plane remain fixed. Polyhedra can be of simple geometric form, or complex surfaces derived from 3D images of real specimens. This algorithm is illustrated using a phantom comprising 989 238 polygons, representing an iso-surface generated from a microtomographic reconstruction of a piece of walrus tusk</title><text>Analytical phantoms are used to generate projection data for testing</text><keywords>tomographic cone-beam projection data;polyhedral phantom;reconstruction accuracy;computed axial tomography;cone-beam transmission tomography;alternative scanning loci;geometrically defined polyhedra;linear attenuation coefficient;microtomographic reconstruction;walrus tusk</keywords></doc>

It is especially useful to select control structures systematically at the early stage of control system design because the only information needed for DIC is the steady-state process gain matrix. Here, a necessary and sufficient condition conjectured in the literature is proved. The real structured singular value which can exploit realness of the controller gain is used to describe computable conditions for DIC. The primary usage of DIC is to eliminate unworkable pairings. For this, two other simple necessary conditions are proposed.

<doc><title>Development of visual design steering as an aid in large-scale multidisciplinary design optimization. I. Method development steering (VDS), is developed in this paper. The VDS paradigm is applied to optimal design problems to provide a means for capturing and enabling designer insights. VDS allows a designer to make decisions before, during or after an analysis or optimization via a visual environment, in order to effectively steer the solution process. The objective of VDS is to obtain a better solution in less time through the use of designer knowledge and expertise. Using visual representations of complex systems in this manner enables human experience and judgement to be incorporated into the optimal design process at appropriate steps, rather than having traditional black box solvers return solutions from a prescribed input set. Part I of this paper focuses on the research issues pertaining to the Graph Morphing visualization method created to represent an n-dimensional optimization problem using 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional visualizations. Part II investigates the implementation of the VDS paradigm, using the graph morphing approach, to improve an optimal design process. Specifically, the following issues are addressed: impact of design variable changes on the optimal design space; identification of possible constraint redundancies; impact of constraint tolerances on the optimal solution: and smoothness of the objective function contours. It is demonstrated that graph morphing can effectively reduce the complexity and computational time associated with some optimization problems</title><text>A modified paradigm of computational steering (CS), termed visual design</text><keywords>visual design steering;large-scale multidisciplinary design optimization;computational steering;optimal design problems;visual representations;complex systems;graph morphing visualization method;n-dimensional optimization;computational time;complexity;design variable changes;constraint redundancies;constraint tolerances</keywords></doc>

Previous studies have not properly accounted for these historical effects. The initialization response, along with the forced response, for fractional-order systems is determined. The scalar fractional-order impulse response is determined, and is a generalization of the exponential function. Stability properties of fractional-order systems are presented in the complex w-plane, which is a transformation of the s-plane. Time responses are discussed with respect to pole positions in the complex w-plane and frequency response behavior is included. A fractional-order vector space representation, which is a generalization of the state space concept, is presented including the initialization response. Control methods for vector representations of initialized fractional-order systems are shown.

<doc><title>Rational systems exhibit moderate risk aversion with respect to "gambles" on variable-resolution compression naturally defines the spatial relationship on the hierarchical pyramid. Transform coefficients over each tree correspond to a unique local spatial region of the original image, and they can be coded bit-plane by bit-plane through successive-approximation quantization. After receiving the approximate value of some coefficients, the decoder can obtain a reconstructed image. We show a rational system for progressive transmission that, in absence of a priori knowledge about regions of interest, chooses at any truncation time among alternative trees for further transmission in such a way as to avoid certain forms of behavioral inconsistency. We prove that some rational transmission systems might exhibit aversion to risk involving "gambles" on tree-dependent quality of encoding while others favor taking such risks. Based on an acceptable predictor for visual distinctness from digital imagery, we demonstrate that, without any outside knowledge, risk-prone systems as well as those with strong risk aversion appear in capable of attaining the quality of reconstructions that can be achieved with moderate risk-averse behavior</title><text>In an embedded wavelet scheme for progressive transmission, a tree structure</text><keywords>variable-resolution compression;progressive transmission;rational system;moderate risk aversion;embedded wavelet scheme;tree structure;transform coefficients;local spatial region;successive-approximation quantization;reconstructed image;truncation time;gambles;acceptable predictor;visual distinctness;digital imagery</keywords></doc>
<doc><title>Four-terminal quantum resistor network for electron-wave computing quasi-one-dimensional electron waveguides, which form a quantum resistor network, are presented here in four-terminal configurations. The transmission behaviors through such four-terminal networks are evaluated and classified. In addition, we show that such networks can be used as the basic building blocks for a possible massive wave computing machine in the future. In a network, each interconnection, a node point, is an elastic scatterer that routes the electron wave. Routing and rerouting of electron waves in a network is described in the framework of quantum transport from Landauer-Buttiker theory in the presence of multiple elastic scatterers. Transmissions through various types of four-terminal generalized clean Aharonov-Bohm rings are investigated at zero temperature. Useful logic functions are gathered based on the transmission probability to each terminal with the use of the Buttiker symmetry rule. In the generalized rings, even and odd numbers of terminals can possess some distinctly different transmission characteristics as we have shown here and earlier. Just as an even or odd number of atoms in a ring is an important quantity for classifying the transmission behavior, we show here that whether the number of terminals is an even or an odd number is just as important in understanding the physics of transmission through such a ring. Furthermore, we show that there are three basic classes of four-terminal rings and the scaling relation for each class is provided. In particular, the existence of equitransmission among all four terminals is shown here. This particular physical phenomena cannot exist in any three-terminal ring. Comparisons and discussions of transmission characteristics between three-terminal and four-terminal rings are also presented. The node-equation approach by considering the Kirchhoff current conservation law at each node point is used for this analysis. Many useful logic functions for electron-wave computing are shown here. In particular, we show that a full adder can be constructed very simply using the equitransmission property of the four-terminal ring. This is in sharp contrast with circuits based on transistor logic</title><text>Interconnected ultrathin conducting wires or, equivalently, interconnected</text><keywords>four-terminal quantum resistor network;electron-wave computing;interconnected ultrathin conducting wires;rerouting;Landauer-Buttiker theory;multiple elastic scatterers;Aharonov-Bohm rings;logic functions;transmission probability;Buttiker symmetry rule;transmission behavior;Kirchhoff current conservation law;equitransmission property</keywords></doc>

While such a thesis has been defended by several authors elsewhere, our primary concern here is to take up the issue of the compatibility of selective representing and realism. We hope to show three things. First, that the notion of selective representing is fully consistent with the realist idea of a mind-independent world. Second, that not only are these two consistent, but that the latter (the realist conception of a mind-independent world) provides the most powerful perspective from which to motivate and understand the differing perceptual and cognitive profiles themselves.

<doc><title>A building block approach to automated engineering recognized the need to automate engineering functions and create an interactive model of its distribution system in the early 1990s. It had used Milsoft's DA software for more than 10 years to make engineering studies, and had a Landis and Gyr SCADA system and a hybrid load management system for controlling water heater switches. With the development of GIS and facilities management (FM) applications, SVEC decided this should be the basis for an information system that would model its physical plant and interface with its accounting and billing systems. It could add applications such as outage management, staking, line design and metering to use this information and interface with these databases. However, based on SVEC's size it was not feasible to implement a sophisticated and expensive GIS/FM system. Over the past nine years, SVEC has had success with a building block approach, and its customers and employees are realizing the benefits of the automated applications.

Open-loop estimators or closed-loop observers are used for this purpose. They differ with respect to accuracy, robustness, and sensitivity against model parameter variations. Dynamic performance and steady-state speed accuracy in the low-speed range can be achieved by exploiting parasitic effects of the machine.

<doc><title>A novel genetic algorithm for the design of a signed power-of-two coefficient quadrature mirror filter lattice filter bank power-of-two (SPT) coefficient lattice structure quadrature mirror filter bank is presented. Genetic operations may render the SPT representation of a value noncanonical. A new encoding scheme is introduced to encode the SPT values. In this new scheme, the canonical property of the SPT values is preserved under genetic operations. Additionally, two new features that drastically improve the performance of our GA are introduced. (1) An additional level of natural selection is introduced to simulate the effect of natural selection when sperm cells compete to fertilize an ovule; this dramatically improves the offspring survival rate.

<doc><title>Development of a computer-aided manufacturing system for profiled edge lamination tooling involving the assembly of an array of laminations whose top edges are simultaneously profiled and beveled based on a CAD model of the intended tool surface. To facilitate adoption of this RT method by industry, a comprehensive PEL tooling development system is proposed. The two main parts of this system are: (1) iterative tool design based on thermal and structural models; and (2) fabrication of the tool using a computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) software and abrasive water jet cutting. CAM software has been developed to take lamination slice data (profiles) from any proprietary RP software in the form of polylines and create smooth, kinematically desirable cutting trajectories for each tool lamination. Two cutting trajectory algorithms, called identical equidistant profile segmentation and adaptively vector profiles projection (AVPP), were created for this purpose. By comparing the performance of both algorithms with a benchmark part shape, the AVPP algorithm provided better cutting trajectories for complicated tool geometries. A 15-layer aluminum PEL tool was successfully fabricated using a 5-axis CNC AWJ cutter and NC code generated by the CAM software</title><text>Profiled edge lamination (PEL) tooling is a promising rapid tooling (RT) method</text><keywords>profiled edge lamination tooling;rapid tooling;abrasive water jet cutting;CAM software;cutting trajectory algorithms;identical equidistant profile segmentation;adaptively vector profiles projection</keywords></doc>
<doc><title>H/sub 2/ optimization of the three-element type dynamic vibration absorbers which is attached to a vibrating body (called a primary system) subjected to exciting force or motion. In this paper, we will discuss an optimization problem of the three-element type DVA on the basis of the H/sub 2/ optimization criterion. The objective of the H/sub 2/ optimization is to reduce the total vibration energy of the system for overall frequencies; the total area under the power spectrum response curve is minimized in this criterion. If the system is subjected to random excitation instead of sinusoidal excitation, then the H/sub 2/ optimization is probably more desirable than the popular H/sub infinity / optimization. In the past decade there has been increasing interest in the three-element type DVA. However, most previous studies on this type of DVA were based on the H/sub infinity / optimization design, and no one has been able to find the algebraic solution as of yet. We found a closed-form exact solution for a special case where the primary system has no damping. Furthermore, the general case solution including the damped primary system is presented in the form of a numerical solution. The optimum parameters obtained here are compared to those of the conventional Voigt type DVA. They are also compared to other optimum parameters based on the H/sub infinity / criterion</title><text>The dynamic vibration absorber (DVA) is a passive vibration control device</text><keywords>passive vibration control;power spectrum response;three-element type dynamic vibration absorbers</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>International swinging: making Swing components locale-sensitive highly customizable framework for creating truly "international" applications, the Swing library is not sensitive to locale switches: it cannot automatically change an application's appearance to conform to the conventions of a specific locale at run time. Several types of applications benefit from the ability to easily switch the language at run time. Training applications and other programs that run on computers in public spaces (such as libraries, airports, or government offices) may need to support multiple languages. Other applications (like travel dictionaries or translation programs) are inherently multilingual and are specifically designed to support users of dissimilar tongues. Such applications would greatly benefit if the user-interface language could be customized at run time. The article shows you how to customize Swing to support locale switching at run time.

<doc><title>A dynamic checkpoint scheduling scheme for fault tolerant distributed computing systems issue in implementing checkpointing-recovery schemes for fault tolerant distributed systems. This paper presents a new scheme that allows a process to select the proper checkpointing interval dynamically. A process in the system evaluates the cost of checkpointing and possible rollback for each checkpointing interval and selects the proper time interval for the next checkpointing. Unlike the other schemes, the overhead incurred by both the checkpointing and rollback activities are considered for the cost evaluation, and the current communication pattern is reflected in the selection of the checkpointing interval. Moreover, the proposed scheme requires no extra message communication for the checkpointing interval selection and can easily be incorporated into the existing checkpointing coordination schemes</title><text>The selection of the optimal checkpointing interval has been a very critical</text><keywords>dynamic checkpoint scheduling scheme;distributed computing systems;optimal checkpointing interval;cost evaluation;communication pattern</keywords></doc>
<doc><title>Using constructed types in C++ unions nontrivial constructor or destructor. While at first this seems unreasonable, further thought makes it clear why this is the case: The crux of the problem is that unions don't have built-in semantics for denoting when a member is the "current" member of the union. Therefore, the compiler can't know when it's appropriate to call constructors or destructors on the union members. Still, there are good reasons for wanting to use constructed object types in a union. For example, you might want to implement a scripting language with a single variable type that can either be an integer, a string, or a list. A union is the perfect candidate for implementing such a composite type, but the restriction on constructed union members may prevent you from using an existing string or list class (for example, from the STL) to provide the underlying functionality. Luckily, a feature of C++ called placement new can provide a workaround</title><text>The C++ Standard states that a union type cannot have a member with a</text><keywords>C++ Standard;union type;constructors;destructors;union members;scripting language;placement new</keywords></doc>
<doc><title>Data extraction from the Web based on pre-defined schema invaluable information source for most organizations. However, most documents available from the Web are in HTML form which is originally designed for document formatting with little consideration of its contents. Effectively extracting data from such documents remains a nontrivial task. In this paper, we present a schema-guided approach to extracting data from HTML pages. Under the approach, the user defines a schema specifying what to be extracted and provides sample mappings between the schema and the HTML page. The system will induce the mapping rules and generate a wrapper that takes the HTML page as input and produces the required data in the form of XML conforming to the user-defined schema. A prototype system implementing the approach has been developed. The preliminary experiments indicate that the proposed semi-automatic approach is not only easy to use but also able to produce a wrapper that extracts required data from inputted pages with high accuracy</title><text>With the development of the Internet, the World Wide Web has become an</text><keywords>data extraction;Internet;information source;schema;HTML</keywords></doc>
<doc><title>Direct aperture optimization: A turnkey solution for step-and-shoot IMRT produced through the optimization of intensity distributions (or maps) for each beam angle. The optimization step is followed by the application of a leaf-sequencing algorithm that translates each intensity map into a set of deliverable aperture shapes. In this article, we introduce an automated planning system in which we bypass the traditional intensity optimization, and instead directly optimize the shapes and the weights of the apertures. We call this approach "direct aperture optimization." This technique allows the user to specify the maximum number of apertures per beam direction, and hence provides significant control over the complexity of the treatment delivery. This is possible because the machine dependent delivery constraints imposed by the MLC are enforced within the aperture optimization algorithm rather than in a separate leaf-sequencing step. The leaf settings and the aperture intensities are optimized simultaneously using a simulated annealing algorithm. We have tested direct aperture optimization on a variety of patient cases using the EGS4/BEAM Monte Carlo package for our dose calculation engine. The results demonstrate that direct aperture optimization can produce highly conformal step-and-shoot treatment plans using only three to five apertures per beam direction. As compared with traditional optimization strategies, our studies demonstrate that direct aperture optimization can result in a significant reduction in both the number of beam segments and the number of monitor units. Direct aperture optimization therefore produces highly efficient treatment deliveries that maintain the full dosimetric benefits of IMRT</title><text>IMRT treatment plans for step-and-shoot delivery have traditionally been</text><keywords>direct aperture optimization;turnkey solution;step-and-shoot IMRT;IMRT treatment plans;intensity distributions;maps;beam angle;optimization step;leaf-sequencing algorithm;intensity map;deliverable aperture shapes;automated planning system;aperture shapes;machine dependent delivery constraints;MLC;aperture optimization algorithm;leaf settings;aperture intensities;simulated annealing algorithm;patient cases;EGS4/BEAM Monte Carlo package;dose calculation engine;highly conformal step-and-shoot treatment plans;beam segments;monitor units;highly efficient treatment deliveries;full dosimetric benefits</keywords></doc>

In this paper, the SC problem is re-examined in a general network, in which the components (processors and communication links) may be subjected to different faulty types simultaneously (also called the hybrid fault model or mixed faulty types) and the network topology does not have to be fully connected.

<doc><title>The Tattletale technique resources (mutexes, database connections, transactions, file handles, etc.) require timely and systematic release. Unfortunately, Java's garbage collector is not up to that job. According to the Java Language Specification, there are no guarantees when a garbage collector will run, when it will collect an object, or when it will finalize an object - if ever. Even more unfortunately, Java's counterpart to the C++ destructor (the finally block) is both tedious and error-prone, requiring developers to constantly remember and duplicate resource-releasing code. Consequently, even good Java developers can forget to release critical resources. There is a light at the end of the tunnel. Java may make it easier to leak critical resources, but it also provides the necessary mechanisms to easily track them down. The Tattletale technique is a simple method for designing new classes and retrofitting existing classes to quickly and easily detect the offending code responsible for leaking resources</title><text>Practical experience has taught many Java developers one thing: critical</text><keywords>Java;critical resources;mutexes;database connections;transactions;file handles;garbage collector;resource-releasing code;Tattletale technique</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>Towards an ontology of approximate reason reason. The basic assumption in this ontology is that approximate reason is a capability of an agent. Agents are designed to classify information granules derived from sensors that respond to stimuli in the environment of an agent or received from other agents. Classification of information granules is carried out in the context of parameterized approximation spaces and a calculus of granules. Judgment in agents is a faculty of thinking about (classifying) the particular relative to decision rules derived from data. Judgment in agents is reflective, but not in the classical philosophical sense (e.g., the notion of judgment in Kant). In an agent, a reflective judgment itself is an assertion that a particular decision rule derived from data is applicable to an object (input). That is, a reflective judgment by an agent is an assertion that a particular vector of attribute (sensor) values matches to some degree the conditions for a particular rule. In effect, this form of judgment is an assertion that a vector of sensor values reflects a known property of data expressed by a decision rule. Since the reasoning underlying a reflective judgment is inductive and surjective (not based on a priori conditions or universals), this form of judgment is reflective, but not in the sense of Kant. Unlike Kant, a reflective judgment is surjective in the sense that it maps experimental attribute values onto the most closely matching descriptors (conditions) in a derived rule. Again, unlike Kant's notion of judgment, a reflective judgment is not the result of searching for a universal that pertains to a particular set of values of descriptors. Rather, a reflective judgment by an agent is a form of recognition that a particular vector of sensor values pertains to a particular rule in some degree. This recognition takes the form of an assertion that a particular descriptor vector is associated with a particular decision rule. These considerations can be repeated for other forms of classifiers besides those defined by decision rules</title><text>This article introduces structural aspects in an ontology of approximate</text><keywords>ontology;approximate reason;information granules;parameterized approximation spaces;granules;decision rules;reflective judgment</keywords></doc>

Optimal scheduling of AGVs can significantly help to increase the efficiency of the manufacturing process by minimizing the idle time of MCs waiting for the raw materials. We analyse the requirements for an optimal schedule and then provide a mathematical framework for an efficient schedule of material delivery by an AGV. A mathematical model is developed and then a strategy for optimal material distribution of the available raw material to the MCs is derived. With this model, the optimal number of MCs to be utilized is also determined. Finally, the material delivery schedule employing multiple journeys to the MCs by the AGV is carried out. Through rigorous analysis and simulation experiments, we show that such a delivery strategy will optimize the overall performance</title><text>Modern automated manufacturing processes employ automated guided vehicles</text><keywords>optimal material distribution policies;flexible manufacturing systems;AGV;automated guided vehicle;material handling;machine centres;optimal scheduling;material delivery</keywords></doc>

This novel approach, called wavepath, reduces the influence of the user-defined start- and endpoints of the vessel segment and is therefore more robust and improves the reproducibility of the lesion quantification substantially. The validation study shows that the wavepath method is totally constant in the middle part of the pathline, even when using the method for constructing a bifurcation or sidebranch pathline. Furthermore, the number of corrections needed to guide the wavepath through the correct vessel is decreased from an average of 0.44 corrections per pathline to an average of 0.12 per pathline. Therefore, it can be concluded that the wavepath algorithm improves the overall analysis substantially</title><text>Presents a new pathline approach, based on the wavefront propagation principle,</text><keywords>wavefront propagation principle;quantitative coronary artery analysis;vessel segment;lesion quantification;wavepath method;bifurcation;sidebranch pathline;corrections;correct vessel;wavefront propagation algorithm;X-ray angiograms</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>Coarse-grained reduction and analysis of a network model of cortical response: I. Drifting grating stimuli developed by McLaughlin, Shapley, Shelley, and Wielaard. The reduction is from many integrate-and-fire neurons to a spatially coarse-grained system for firing rates of neuronal subpopulations. It accounts explicitly for spatially varying architecture, ordered cortical maps (such as orientation preference) that vary regularly across the cortical layer, and disordered cortical maps (such as spatial phase preference or stochastic input conductances) that may vary widely from cortical neuron to cortical neuron. The result of the reduction is a set of nonlinear spatiotemporal integral equations for "phase-averaged" firing rates of neuronal subpopulations across the model cortex, derived asymptotically from the full model without the addition of any extra phenomological constants. This reduced system is used to study the response of the model to drifting grating stimuli - where it is shown to be useful for numerical investigations that reproduce, at far less computational cost, the salient features of the point-neuron network and for analytical investigations that unveil cortical mechanisms behind the responses observed in the simulations of the large-scale computational model. For example, the reduced equations clearly show (1) phase averaging as the source of the time-invariance of cortico-cortical conductances, (2) the mechanisms in the model for higher firing rates and better orientation selectivity of simple cells which are near pinwheel centers, (3) the effects of the length-scales of cortico-cortical coupling, and (4) the role of noise in improving the contrast invariance of orientation selectivity</title><text>We present a reduction of a large-scale network model of visual cortex</text><keywords>large-scale network model;visual cortex;point-neuron network;phase-averaged firing rates;nonlinear spatiotemporal integral equations;orientation selectivity</keywords></doc>
<doc><title>Node-capacitated ring routing along with its fractional relaxation, the node-capacitated multicommodity flow problem. For the feasibility problem, Farkas' lemma provides a characterization for general undirected graphs, asserting roughly that there exists such a flow if and only if the so-called distance inequality holds for every choice of distance functions arising from nonnegative node weights. For rings, this (straightforward) result will be improved in two ways. We prove that, independent of the integrality of node capacities, it suffices to require the distance inequality only for distances arising from (0-1-2)-valued node weights, a requirement that will be called the double-cut condition. Moreover, for integer-valued node capacities, the double-cut condition implies the existence of a half-integral multicommodity flow. In this case there is even an integer-valued multicommodity flow that violates each node capacity by at most one. Our approach gives rise to a combinatorial, strongly polynomial algorithm to compute either a violating double-cut or a node-capacitated multicommodity flow. A relation of the problem to its edge-capacitated counterpart will also be explained</title><text>We consider the node-capacitated routing problem in an undirected ring network</text><keywords>node-capacitated routing problem;node-capacitated ring routing;undirected ring network;fractional relaxation;node-capacitated multicommodity flow problem;feasibility problem;undirected graphs;distance inequality;distance functions;nonnegative node weights;double-cut condition;integer-valued node capacities;half-integral multicommodity flow;integer-valued multicommodity flow;violating double-cut</keywords></doc>

The obtained network can be used in the same way as a CPN to model and control dynamic systems, while it has a faster learning speed than the original back-propagation algorithm. The comparative results on the examples suggest that the method is fairly efficient in terms of simple structure, fast learning speed, and relatively high modeling accuracy</title><text>This paper describes an improved self-organizing CPN-based (Counter-Propagation</text><keywords>neural-fuzzy system;hybrid learning;gradient descent;structure learning;initial parameters setting</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>A method for geometrical verification of dynamic intensity modulated radiotherapy using a scanning electronic portal imaging device radiotherapy (IMRT), verification of the leaf trajectories during the treatment is necessary. Our aim in this study is to develop a method for on-line verification of leaf trajectories using an electronic portal imaging device with scanning read-out, independent of the multileaf collimator. Examples of such scanning imagers are electronic portal imaging devices (EPIDs) based on liquid-filled ionization chambers and those based on amorphous silicon. Portal images were acquired continuously with a liquid-filled ionization chamber EPID during the delivery, together with the signal of treatment progress that is generated by the accelerator. For each portal image, the prescribed leaf and diaphragm positions were computed from the dynamic prescription and the progress information. Motion distortion effects of the leaves are corrected based on the treatment progress that is recorded for each image row. The aperture formed by the prescribed leaves and diaphragms is used as the reference field edge, while the actual field edge is found using a maximum-gradient edge detector. The errors in leaf and diaphragm position are found from the deviations between the reference field edge and the detected field edge. Earlier measurements of the dynamic EPID response show that the accuracy of the detected field edge is better than 1 mm. To ensure that the verification is independent of inaccuracies in the acquired progress signal, the signal was checked with diode measurements beforehand. The method was tested on three different dynamic prescriptions. Using the described method, we correctly reproduced the distorted field edges. Verifying a single portal image took 0.1 s on an 866 MHz personal computer. Two flaws in the control system of our experimental dynamic multileaf collimator were correctly revealed with our method. First, the errors in leaf position increase with leaf speed, indicating a delay of approximately 0.8 s in the control system. Second, the accuracy of the leaves and diaphragms depends on the direction of motion. In conclusion, the described verification method is suitable for detailed verification of leaf trajectories during dynamic IMRT</title><text>In order to guarantee the safe delivery of dynamic intensity modulated</text><keywords>dynamic intensity modulated radiotherapy;dynamic multileaf collimator;safe delivery;leaf trajectories;on-line verification;scanning read-out;liquid-filled ionization chambers;leaf positions;diaphragm positions;motion distortion effects;reference field edge;distorted field edges;control system</keywords></doc>
<doc><title>On-line robust processing techniques for elimination of measurement drop-out normally distributed measurement noise is present. In some situations, outliers are present in the measurements and consequently the noise is far from normally distributed. In this case classical least-squares procedures for estimating Fourier spectra (or derived quantities like the frequency response function) can give results which are inaccurate or even useless. In this paper, a novel technique for the on-line processing of measurement outliers will be proposed. Both the computation speed and the accuracy of the technique presented will be compared with different classical approaches for handling outliers in measurement data (i.e. filtering techniques, outlier rejection techniques and robust regression techniques). In particular, all processing techniques will be validated by applying them to the problem of speckle drop-out in optical vibration measurements (performed with a laser Doppler vibrometer), which typically causes outliers in the measurements</title><text>When processing measurement data, it is usually assumed that some amount of</text><keywords>on-line robust processing techniques;normally distributed measurement noise;classical least-squares procedures;Fourier spectra;frequency response function;measurement outliers;computation speed;optical vibration measurements;laser Doppler vibrometer;robust regression</keywords></doc>

Thus parallel computing is still unpopular in the computational science community, even though parallel programming is common to the computer science community. As users would like to run the same source code on parallel machines with different architectures as fast as possible, we have investigated the compatibility of source codes for Japanese HPF compilers (NEC, Fujitsu and Hitachi) with two real-world applications: a 3D fluid code and a 2D particle code. We have found that the source-level compatibility between Japanese HPF compilers is almost preserved, but more effort will be needed to sustain complete compatibility. We have also evaluated parallel performance and found that HPF can achieve good performance for the 3D fluid code with almost the same source code. For the 2D particle code, good results have also been obtained with a small number of processors, but some changes in the original source code and the addition of interface blocks is required</title><text>The lack of compatibility of High-Performance Fortran (HPF) between vender</text><keywords>High-Performance Fortran;HPF;portable programs;parallel programming;compilers;parallel performance</keywords></doc>

Using this rule set instead of the complete class association rule set we can avoid redundant computation that would otherwise be required for mining predictive association rules and hence improve the efficiency of the mining process significantly. We present an efficient algorithm for mining the optimal class association rule set using an upward closure property of pruning weak rules before they are actually generated. We have implemented the algorithm and our experimental results show that our algorithm generates the optimal class association rule set, whose size is smaller than 1/17 of the complete class association rule set on average, in significantly less time than generating the complete class association rule set.

The suggested method, called utterance level scoring (ULS), allows one to obtain a normalized score using a single pass through the frames of the tested utterance. The utterance sample covariance is first calculated and then compared to the speaker covariance using a distortion measure. Subsequently, a distortion measure between the utterance covariance and the sample covariance of data taken from different speakers is used to normalize the score. Experimental results from the 2000 NIST speaker recognition evaluation are presented for ULS, used with different distortion measures, and for a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) system. The results indicate that ULS as a viable alternative to GMM whenever the computational complexity and verification accuracy needs to be traded</title><text>This paper describes a computationally simple method to perform text</text><keywords>text-independent speaker verification;utterance level scoring;covariance modeling;computationally simple method;second order statistics;normalized score;sample covariance;speaker covariance;distortion measure;NIST speaker recognition evaluation;distortion measures;Gaussian mixture model;GMM;computational complexity;verification accuracy</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>A leaf sequencing algorithm to enlarge treatment field length in IMRT maximum field size for conventional treatments. This is due to the constraints of the overtravel distances of MLC leaves and/or jaws. Using a new leaf sequencing algorithm, the usable IMRT field length (perpendicular to the MLC motion) can be mostly made equal to the full length of the MLC field without violating the upper jaw overtravel limit. For any given intensity pattern, a criterion was proposed to assess whether an intensity pattern can be delivered without violation of the jaw position constraints. If the criterion is met, the new algorithm will consider the jaw position constraints during the segmentation for the step and shoot delivery method. The strategy employed by the algorithm is to connect the intensity elements outside the jaw overtravel limits with those inside the jaw overtravel limits. Several methods were used to establish these connections during segmentation by modifying a previously published algorithm (areal algorithm), including changing the intensity level, alternating the leaf-sequencing direction, or limiting the segment field size. The algorithm was tested with 1000 random intensity patterns with dimensions of 21*27 cm/sup 2/, 800 intensity patterns with higher intensity outside the jaw overtravel limit, and three different types of clinical treatment plans that were undeliverable using a segmentation method from a commercial treatment planning system. The new algorithm achieved a success rate of 100% with these test patterns. For the 1000 random patterns, the new algorithm yields a similar average number of segments of 36.9+or-2.9 in comparison to 36.6+or-1.3 when using the areal algorithm. For the 800 patterns with higher intensities outside the jaw overtravel limits, the new algorithm results in an increase of 25% in the average number of segments compared to the areal algorithm. However, the areal algorithm fails to create deliverable segments for 90% of these patterns. Using a single isocenter, the new algorithm provides a solution to extend the usable IMRT field length from 21 to 27 cm for IMRT on a commercial linear accelerator using the step and shoot delivery method</title><text>With MLC-based IMRT, the maximum usable field size is often smaller than the</text><keywords>leaf sequencing algorithm;overtravel distances;upper jaw overtravel limit;intensity pattern;jaw position constraints;step and shoot delivery method;commercial treatment planning system;random patterns;deliverable segments;single isocenter;commercial linear accelerator;treatment field length;intensity elements;jaw overtravel limits;areal algorithm;leaf-sequencing direction;segment field size;random intensity patterns;segmentation method</keywords></doc>

A model for an SMA actuated manipulator is presented. The model includes nonlinear dynamics of the manipulator, a constitutive model of Shape Memory Alloy, and electrical and heat transfer behavior of SMA wire. This model is used for open and closed loop motion simulations of the manipulator. Experiments are presented that show results similar to both closed and open loop simulation results. Due to modeling uncertainty and nonlinear behavior of the system, classic control methods such as Proportional-Integral-Derivative control are not able to present fast and accurate performance. Hence a nonlinear, robust control algorithm is presented based on Variable Structure Control. This algorithm is a control gain switching technique based on the weighted average of position and velocity feedbacks. This method has been designed through simulation and tested experimentally. Results show fast, accurate, and robust performance of the control system. Computer simulation and experimental results for different stabilization and tracking situations are also presented</title><text>This paper presents a nonlinear, robust control algorithm for accurate</text><keywords>shape memory alloy;manipulator;open loop;closed loop;variable structure control;control gain switching;nonlinear control;feedback;stabilization;tracking;positioning;nonlinear dynamics</keywords></doc>

We used 1433 (931 benign) biopsy-proven mammographic cases. CBR similarity was defined using either the Hamming or Euclidean distance measure over case features. Ten features represented each case: calcification distribution, calcification morphology, calcification number, mass margin, mass shape, mass density, mass size, associated findings, special cases, and age. Performance was evaluated using Round Robin sampling, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis, and bootstrap. To determine the most influential features for the CBR, an exhaustive feature search was performed over all possible feature combinations (1022) and similarity thresholds. Influential features were defined as the most frequently occurring features in the feature subsets with the highest partial ROC areas (/sub 0.90/AUC). For CBR with Hamming distance, the most influential features were found to be mass margin, calcification morphology, age, calcification distribution, calcification number, and mass shape, resulting in an /sub 0.90/AUC of 0.33. At 95% sensitivity, the Hamming CBR would spare from biopsy 34% of the benign lesions. At 98% sensitivity, the Hamming CBR would spare 27% benign lesions. For the CBR with Euclidean distance, the most influential feature subset consisted of mass margin, calcification morphology, age, mass density, and associated findings, resulting in /sub 0.90/AUC of 0.37. At 95% sensitivity, the Euclidean CBR would spare from biopsy 41% benign lesions. At 98% sensitivity, the Euclidean CBR would spare 27% benign lesions. The profile of cases spared by both distance measures at 98% sensitivity indicates that the CBR is a potentially useful diagnostic tool for the classification of mammographic lesions, by recommending short-term follow-up for likely benign lesions that is in agreement with final biopsy results and mammographer's intuition</title><text>Approximately 70-85% of breast biopsies are performed on benign lesions.

The semantics formally specifies nearly all the details of the Haskell 98 type system, including the resolution of overloading, kind inference (including defaulting) and polymorphic recursion, the only major omission being a proper treatment of ambiguous overloading and its resolution. Overloading is translated into explicit dictionary passing, as in all current implementations of Haskell. The target language of this translation is a variant of the Girard-Reynolds polymorphic lambda calculus featuring higher order polymorphism. and explicit type abstraction and application in the term language. Translated programs can thus still be type checked, although the implicit version of this system is impredicative.

We use findings from information systems research to structure a meta-analysis of uptake issues as reported in CSCW case studies, supplemented by a detailed re-examination of one of our own case studies from this perspective. This shows that while there are some factors which seem to be largely specific to CSCW introductions, many of the case study results are very similar to standard IS findings.

<doc><title>A feature-preserving volumetric technique to merge surface triangulations extraction of isosurfaces from a distance map defined on an adaptive background grid are presented. The main objective is to extend the application of these algorithms to surfaces with sharp edges and comers. In order to deal with objects of different length scales, the initial background grids are created using a Delaunay triangulation method and local voxelizations. A point enrichment technique that introduces points into the background grid along detected surface features such as ridges is used to ensure that these features are preserved in the final merged surface. The surface merging methodology is extended to include other Boolean operations between surface triangulations. The iso-surface extraction algorithms are modified to obtain the correct iso-surface for multi-component objects. The procedures are demonstrated with various examples, ranging from simple geometrical entities to complex engineering applications.

The investigated qualitative property in this paper is the conservation of the monotonicity in space of the initial heat distribution. We prove some statements about the monotonicity conservation and total monotonicity of one-step vector-iterations. Then, applying these results, we consider the numerical solutions of the one-dimensional heat equation.

The process that achieves this goal is commonly referred to as encryption. Although encryption processes of various forms have been employed for centuries to protect the exchange of messages, the advent of the information age has underscored the importance of strong cryptography as a process to secure data exchanged through electronic means, and has accentuated the demand for products offering these services. This article describes the process that has led to the development of the latest cryptographic benchmark; the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).

<doc><title>The development and evaluation of SHOKE2000: the PCI-based FPGA card order to study reconfigurable computing. Since the latest field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) consist of input/output (I/O) configurable blocks as well as internal configurable logic blocks, they not only realize various user logic circuits but also connect with popular I/O standards easily. These features enable FPGA to connect several devices with different interfaces, and thus new reconfigurable systems would be realizable by connecting the FPGA with devices such as digital signal processors (DSP) and analog devices. This paper describes the basic functions of SHOKE2000, which was developed for realizing hybrid reconfigurable systems consisting of FPGA, DSP, and analog devices. We also present application examples of SHOKE2000, including a simple image recognition application, a distributed shared memory computer cluster, and teaching materials for computer education</title><text>This paper describes a PCI-based FPGA card, SHOKE2000, which was developed in</text><keywords>FPGA card;SHOKE2000;reconfigurable computing;field programmable gate arrays;FPGA;I/O standard;interfaces;digital signal processors;DSP;analog devices;hybrid reconfigurable systems;image recognition application;distributed shared memory computer cluster;teaching materials;computer education;user logic circuits</keywords></doc>
<doc><title>Intensity based affine registration including feature similarity for spatial normalization quantitative comparison of brain architecture across different subjects requires a common coordinate system. For the analysis of a specific brain area, it is necessary to normalize and compare a region of interest and the global brain. The intensity based registration method matches the global brain well, but a region of interest may not be locally normalized compared to the feature based method. The method in this paper uses feature similarities of local regions as well as intensity similarities. The lateral ventricle and central gray nuclei of the brain, including the corpus callosum, which is used for features in schizophrenia detection, is appropriately normalized. Our method reduces the difference of feature areas such as the corpus callosum (7.7%, 2.4%) and lateral ventricle (8.2%, 13.5%) compared with mutual information and Talairach methods</title><text>This paper presents a new spatial normalization with affine transformation.

Every finite graph G can be represented by arranging solid balls in the following way: Put red balls in R/sup 3/, one for each vertex of G, and connect two red balls by a chain when they correspond to a pair of adjacent vertices of G, where a chain means a finite sequence of blue solid balls in which each consecutive balls are tangent. (We may omit the chain if the two red balls are already tangent.) The ball number b(G) of G is the minimum number of balls (red and blue) necessary to represent G. If we put the balls and chains on a table so that all balls sit on the table, then the minimum number of balls for G is denoted by bT(G). Among other things, we prove that b(K/sub 6/) = 8, b(K/sub 7/) = 13 and b/sub T/(K/sub 5/) = 8,b/sub T/(K/sub 6/) = 14.

<doc><title>Bistability of harmonically forced relaxation oscillations two states characterized by fast and slow time scales. When a relaxation oscillator is coupled to an external periodic force its entrainment by the force results in a response which can include multiple periodicities and bistability. The prototype of these behaviors is the harmonically driven van der Pol equation which displays regions in the parameter space of the driving force amplitude where stable orbits of periods 2n+or-1 coexist, flanked by regions of periods 2n+1 and 2n-1. The parameter regions of such bistable orbits are derived analytically for the closely related harmonically driven Stoker-Haag piecewise discontinuous equation. The results are valid over most of the control parameter space of the system. Also considered are the reasons for the more complicated dynamics featuring regions of high multiple periodicity which appear like noise between ordered periodic regions. Since this system mimics in detail the less analytically tractable forced van der Pol equation, the results suggest extensions to situations where forced relaxation oscillations are a component of the operating mechanisms</title><text>Relaxation oscillations appear in processes which involve transitions between</text><keywords>bistability;harmonically forced relaxation oscillations;external periodic force;entrainment;van der Pol equation;harmonically driven Stoker-Haag piecewise discontinuous equation;control parameter space</keywords></doc>

Random matrix theory modeling of composite quantum systems, investigated recently, entails a universal distribution of the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrices. We demonstrate that these distributions are realized in quantized chaotic systems by using a model of two coupled and kicked tops. We derive an explicit statistical universal bound on entanglement, which is also valid for the case of unequal dimensionality of the Hilbert spaces involved, and show that this describes well the bounds observed using composite quantized chaotic systems such as coupled tops</title><text>Previous results indicate that while chaos can lead to substantial entropy</text><keywords>statistical bounds;entanglement;quantum chaos;maximality;random matrix theory;composite quantum systems;universal distribution;reduced density matrices;quantized chaotic systems;kicked tops;Hilbert spaces</keywords></doc>
<doc><title>A scalable model of cerebellar adaptive timing and sequencing: the recurrent slide and latch (RSL) model been a favored object of mathematical modeling studies. Early studies focused on the fanout, convergence, thresholding, and learned weighting of perceptual-motor signals within the cerebellar cortex. This led to the still viable idea that the granule cell stage in the cerebellar cortex performs a sparse expansive recoding of the time-varying input vector. This recoding reveals and emphasizes combinations in a distributed representation that serves as a basis for the learned, state-dependent control actions engendered by cerebellar outputs to movement related centers. To make optimal use of available signals, the cerebellum must be able to sift the evolving state representation for the most reliable predictors of the need for control actions, and to use those predictors even if they appear only transiently and well in advance of the optimal time for initiating the control action. The paper proposes a modification to prior, population, models for cerebellar adaptive timing and sequencing. Since it replaces a population with a single element, the proposed RSL model is in one sense maximally efficient, and therefore optimal from the perspective of scalability</title><text>From the dawn of modern neural network theory, the mammalian cerebellum has</text><keywords>scalable model;cerebellar adaptive timing;neural network theory;mammalian cerebellum;granule cell stage;sparse expansive recoding;time-varying input vector;distributed representation</keywords></doc>

Marcus (Cognition 66, p.153; Cognitive Psychology 37, p. 243, 1998) argued that this capacity, called "universal generalization" (universality), is not supported by connectionist models. Instead, universality is best explained by classical symbol systems, with connectionism as its implementation. Here it is argued that universality is also a problem for classicism in that the syntax-sensitive rules that are supposed to provide causal explanations of mental processes are either too strict, precluding possible generalizations; or too lax, providing no information as to the appropriate alternative. Consequently, universality is not explained by a classical theory</title><text>One of the hallmarks of human cognition is the capacity to generalize over</text><keywords>classicism;universality;classical component of mind;human cognition;universal generalization;connectionist models;classical symbol systems;syntax-sensitive rules;causal explanations;mental processes</keywords></doc>

We hypothesize that preoperative contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the patient in a supine position may be used for accurate tumor localization and marking of its extent immediately prior to surgery. Our aims in this study are to assess the reproducibility of mammary gland structure during repeat setups in a supine position, to evaluate the effect of a breast immobilization device, and to derive reproducibility margins that take internal tissue shifts into account occurring between repeat setups. Materials Methods: The reproducibility of mammary gland structure during repeat setups in a supine position is estimated by quantification of tissue shifts in the breasts of healthy volunteers between repeat MR setups. For each volunteer fiducials are identified and registered with their counter locations in corresponding MR volumes. The difference in position denotes the shift of breast tissue. The dependence on breast volume and the part of the breast, as well as the effect of a breast immobilization cast are studied. Results: The tissue shifts are small with a mean standard deviation on the order of 1.5 mm, being slightly larger in large breasts (V>1000 cm/sup 3/), and in the posterior part (toward the pectoral muscle) of both small and large breasts. The application of a breast immobilization cast reduces the tissue shifts in large breasts. A reproducibility margin on the order of 5 mm will take the internal tissue shifts into account that occur between repeat setups.

<doc><title>Perceptual audio coding using adaptive pre- and post-filters and lossless compression high compression ratios and is capable of low encoding/decoding delay. It accommodates a variety of source signals (including both music and speech) with different sampling rates. It is based on separating irrelevance and redundancy reductions into independent functional units. This contrasts traditional audio coding where both are integrated within the same subband decomposition. The separation allows for the independent optimization of the irrelevance and redundancy reduction units. For both reductions, we rely on adaptive filtering and predictive coding as much as possible to minimize the delay. A psycho-acoustically controlled adaptive linear filter is used for the irrelevance reduction, and the redundancy reduction is carried out by a predictive lossless coding scheme, which is termed weighted cascaded least mean squared (WCLMS) method. Experiments are carried out on a database of moderate size which contains mono-signals of different sampling rates and varying nature (music, speech, or mixed). They show that the proposed WCLMS lossless coder outperforms other competing lossless coders in terms of compression ratios and delay, as applied to the pre-filtered signal. Moreover, a subjective listening test of the combined pre-filter/lossless coder and a state-of-the-art perceptual audio coder (PAC) shows that the new method achieves a comparable compression ratio and audio quality with a lower delay</title><text>This paper proposes a versatile perceptual audio coding method that achieves</text><keywords>perceptual audio coding;lossless compression;high compression ratio;low encoding/decoding delay;source signals;music;sampling rates;redundancy reduction;adaptive filtering;predictive coding;psycho-acoustically controlled adaptive linear filter;irrelevance reduction;predictive lossless coding;weighted cascaded least mean squared;WCLMS lossless coder;subjective listening test;pre-filter/lossless coder;audio quality</keywords></doc>
<doc><title>Scalable hybrid computation with spikes features that enable it to scale to systems of large complexity: First, like digital computation, which uses several one-bit precise logical units to collectively compute a precise answer to a computation, the hybrid scheme uses several moderate-precision analog units to collectively compute a precise answer to a computation. Second, frequent discrete signal restoration of the analog information prevents analog noise and offset from degrading the computation. Third, a state machine enables complex computations to be created using a sequence of elementary computations. A natural choice for implementing this hybrid scheme is one based on spikes because spike-count codes are digital, while spike-time codes are analog. We illustrate how spikes afford easy ways to implement all three components of scalable hybrid computation. First, as an important example of distributed analog computation, we show how spikes can create a distributed modular representation of an analog number by implementing digital carry interactions between spiking analog neurons. Second, we show how signal restoration may be performed by recursive spike-count quantization of spike-time codes. Third, we use spikes from an analog dynamical system to trigger state transitions in a digital dynamical system, which reconfigures the analog dynamical system using a binary control vector; such feedback interactions between analog and digital dynamical systems create a hybrid state machine (HSM). The HSM extends and expands the concept of a digital finite-state-machine to the hybrid domain. We present experimental data from a two-neuron HSM on a chip that implements error-correcting analog-to-digital conversion with the concurrent use of spike-time and spike-count codes. We also present experimental data from silicon circuits that implement HSM-based pattern recognition using spike-time synchrony.

Ontological engineering in artificial intelligence has the practical goal of constructing frameworks for knowledge that allow computational systems to tackle knowledge-intensive problems and it supports knowledge sharing and reuse. To illustrate the process of conceptual modelling using the Inferential Modelling Technique as a basis for ontology construction, the tool and processes are applied to build an expert system in the domain of monitoring of a petroleum-production facility</title><text>This paper presents the processes of knowledge acquisition and ontology</text><keywords>knowledge acquisition;knowledge base;intelligent system;ontological engineering;artificial intelligence;inferential modelling technique;petroleum-production facility;ontology modelling;control and monitoring expert system</keywords></doc>
<doc><title>Limitations of delayed state feedback: a numerical study numerical procedure, called the continuous pole placement method [Michiels et al., 2000]. This method can be seen as an extension of the classical pole placement algorithm for ordinary differential equations to a class of delay differential equations. In [Michiels et al., 2000] it was applied to the stabilization of a linear time-invariant system with an input delay using static state feedback. In this paper we study the limitations of such delayed state feedback laws. More precisely we completely characterize the class of stabilizable plants in the 2D-case. For that purpose we make use of numerical continuation techniques. The use of delayed state feedback in various control applications and the effect of its limitations are briefly discussed</title><text>Stabilization of a class of linear time-delay systems can be achieved by a</text><keywords>linear time-delay systems;continuous pole placement method;delay differential equations;static state feedback;delayed state feedback;numerical continuation</keywords></doc>
<doc><title>Development of a real-time monitoring system vector quantization (LVQ). This method is adapted for practical application to solve problems in the area of condition monitoring and fault diagnosis where a number of fault signatures are involved. In these situations, the aim is health monitoring, including identification of deterioration of the healthy condition and identification of causes of the failure in real-time. For this reason a fault database is developed which contains the collected information about various states of operation of the system in the form of pattern vectors. The task of the real-time monitoring system is to correlate patterns of unknown faults with the known fault signatures in the fault database. This will determine cause of failure and degree of deterioration of the system under test. The problem of fault diagnosis may involve a large number of patterns and large sampling time, which affects the learning stage of neural networks. The study here also aims to find a fast learning model of neural networks for instances when a high number of patterns and numerous processing elements are involved. It begins searching for an appropriate solution. The study is extended to the enforcement learning models and considers LVQ as a network emerged from the competitive learning model through enforcement training. Finally, tests show an accuracy of 92.3 per cent in the fault diagnostic capability of the technique</title><text>This paper describes a pattern recognition (PR) technique, which uses learning</text><keywords>real-time monitoring system;LVQ;condition monitoring;fault diagnosis;fault signatures;health monitoring;fault database;pattern vectors;large sampling time;fast learning model;neural networks;competitive learning model;enforcement training;fault diagnostic capability</keywords></doc>

We present an approach for dynamically adapting views according to schema changes arising on source relations. This type of maintenance concerns both the schema and the data of the data warehouse. The main issue is to avoid the view recomputation from scratch especially when views are defined from multiple sources. The data of the data warehouse is used primarily in organizational decision-making and may be strategic. Therefore, the schema of the data warehouse can evolve for modeling new requirements resulting from analysis or data-mining processing.

In this paper, we present a theoretical study of 3D visibility properties for scenes of smooth convex objects. We work in the space of light rays, or more precisely, of maximal free segments. We group segments that "see" the same object; this defines the 3D visibility complex. The boundaries of these groups of segments correspond to the visual events of the scene (limits of shadows, disappearance of an object when the viewpoint is moved, etc.). We provide a worst case analysis of the complexity of the visibility complex of 3D scenes, as well as a probabilistic study under a simple assumption for "normal" scenes. We extend the visibility complex to handle temporal visibility.

Yet theories for such superstructures admit a description in terms of iterated families TF and SF. These are constructed using a definable union taken over countable ordinals in the subsets which are unions of finitely many complete subsets and of finite subsets, respectively.

First, the flow fundamental matrices are optimally computed from the observed flow. They are then decomposed into the focal length, its rate of change, and the motion parameters. Next, the flow is optimally corrected so that it satisfies the epipolar equation exactly. Finally, the 3D positions are computed, and their covariance matrices are evaluated.

<doc><title>Interaction and presence in the clinical relationship: virtual reality (VR) as communicative medium between patient and therapist derives prevalently from the central role, in psychotherapy, occupied by the imagination and by memory. These two elements, which are fundamental in our life, present absolute and relative limits to the individual potential. Using VR as an advanced imaginal system, an experience that is able to reduce the gap existing between imagination and reality, it is possible to transcend these limits. In this sense, VR can improve the efficacy of a psychological therapy for its capability of reducing the distinction between the computer's reality and the conventional reality. Two are the core characteristics of this synthetic imaginal experience: the perceptual illusion of nonmediation and the possibility of building and sharing a common ground. In this sense, experiencing presence in a clinical virtual environment (VE), such as a shared virtual hospital, requires more than reproduction of the physical features of external reality. It requires the creation and sharing of the cultural web that makes meaningful, and therefore visible, both people and objects populating the environment. The paper outlines a framework for supporting the development and tuning of clinically oriented VR systems</title><text>The great potential offered by virtual reality (VR) to clinical psychologists</text><keywords>virtual reality;psychotherapy;imagination;memory;presence;psychological therapy;clinical virtual environment;shared virtual hospital</keywords></doc>

This paper describes a prototype system that uses biased random search to discover a program-specific compilation sequence that minimizes an explicit, external objective function. The result is a compiler framework that adapts its behavior to the application being compiled, to the pool of available transformations, to the objective function, and to the target machine. This paper describes experiments that attempt to characterize the space that the adaptive compiler must search. The preliminary results suggest that optimal solutions are rare and that local minima are frequent. If this holds true, biased random searches, such as a,genetic algorithm, should find good solutions more quickly than simpler strategies, such as hill climbing</title><text>Historically, compilers have operated by applying a fixed set of optimizations</text><keywords>compilers;optimizations;compilation sequence;adaptive compiler;optimizing compilers;biased random search</keywords></doc>

HPF has been effective for programs that a compiler can automatically optimize efficiently. However, once the compiler cannot, there have been no ways for the users to explicitly parallelize or optimize their programs. In order to resolve the situation, we have developed a set of HPF extensions (HPF/JA) to give the users more control over sophisticated parallelization and communication optimizations. They include parallelization of loops with complicated reductions, asynchronous communication, user-controllable shadow, and communication pattern reuse for irregular remote data accesses.

Two versions of a digital maintenance manual were developed, the difference between them being the number of design heuristics observed when designing navigational aids. Neither version was based on an analysis of the tasks carried out by users, nor were users involved in the design process. Instead, the manuals were developed directly from the digital information used to produce the existing paper manual. Usability trials were carried out to test both versions according to the time taken and errors committed by users during typical information retrieval tasks. Users were questioned to determine their ease of use (EOU) perceptions for each manual. The main outcomes were that the navigation aid used in the second version reduced the time taken to use the manual but increased the number of errors made by users. The navigational aid also seemed to reduce the perceived EOU compared with the first version. In both cases, the perceived EOU was lower than for a previous digital manual that had been developed using a task analysis and user input. The paper concludes by recommending the development of a generic task model of user interaction with digital maintenance manuals</title><text>The primary objective was to investigate the value that can be added to a</text><keywords>navigational aid;usability trials;information retrieval;generic task model;user interaction;task analysis</keywords></doc>

As these percentages suggest, women are underrepresented at all academic levels in computer science (Camp, 1997). The most severe shortage occurs at the top level-the doctorate in computer science. We know very little about the women who persist to the top level of academic achievement in computer science. This paper examines a subset of data collected through the Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED). The specific focus of this paper is to identify trends that have emerged from the SED with respect to females completing doctorates in computer science between the academic years 1990-1991 and 1999-2000. Although computer science doctorates include doctorates in information science, prior research (Camp, 1997) suggests that the percentage of women completing doctorates in information science as compared to computer science is low. The specific research questions are: 1. How does the percentage of women who complete doctorates in computer science compare to those that complete doctorates in other fields? 2. How does the length of time in school and the sources of funding differ for females as compared to males who complete doctorates in computer science? 3. Where do women go after completing doctorates in computer science and what positions do they acquire?

<doc><title>An analytic center cutting plane method for semidefinite feasibility problems The abstract form of these problems can be described as finding a point in a nonempty bounded convex body Gamma in the cone of symmetric positive semidefinite matrices. Assume that Gamma is defined by an oracle, which for any given m * m symmetric positive semidefinite matrix Gamma either confirms that Y epsilon Gamma or returns a cut, i.e., a symmetric matrix A such that Gamma is in the half-space {Y : A . Y <or= A . Y}. We study an analytic center cutting plane algorithm for this problem. At each iteration, the algorithm computes an approximate analytic center of a working set defined by the cutting plane system generated in the previous iterations. If this approximate analytic center is a solution, then the algorithm terminates; otherwise the new cutting plane returned by the oracle is added into the system. As the number of iterations increases, the working set shrinks and the algorithm eventually finds a solution to the problem. All iterates generated by the algorithm are positive definite matrices. The algorithm has a worst-case complexity of O*(m/sup 3// epsilon /sup 2/) on the total number of cuts to be used, where epsilon is the maximum radius of a ball contained by Gamma</title><text>Semidefinite feasibility problems arise in many areas of operations research.</text><keywords>semidefinite feasibility problems;analytic center cutting plane method;operations research;nonempty bounded convex body;symmetric positive semidefinite matrices;oracle;iteration;approximate analytic center;working set;worst-case complexity</keywords></doc>

MANET is an emerging research area with practical applications. However, wireless MANET is particularly vulnerable due to its fundamental characteristics, such as open medium, dynamic topology, distributed cooperation, and constrained capability. Routing plays an important role in the security of the entire network. In general, routing security in wireless MANETs appears to be a problem that is not trivial to solve. In this article we study the routing security issues of MANETs, and analyze in detail one type of attack-the "black hole" problem-that can easily be employed against the MANETs.

The first scheme recognizes speakers by employing the classical backpropagation algorithm pre-trained with known voice samples of the persons. The second scheme provides a framework for classifying the known training samples of the voice features using a hierarchical architecture realized with a self-organizing feature map neural net. The first scheme is highly robust as it is capable of identifying the personnel from their noisy voice samples, but because of its excessive training time it has limited applications for a large voice database. The second scheme though not so robust as the former, however, can classify an unknown voice sample to its nearest class. The time needed for classification by the first scheme is always unique irrespective of the voice sample. It is proportional to the number of feedforward layers in the network. The time-requirement of the second classification scheme, however, is not free from the voice features and is proportional to the number of 2D arrays traversed by the algorithm on the hierarchical structure. The third scheme is highly robust and mis-classification is as low as 0.2 per cent.

Here, W is the total power of the reflected light, and c is the speed of light. Radiation pressure, as it is known, is nearly insignificant for most macroscale applications, but it can be quite significant for MEMS devices. In addition, light actuation offers a new paradigm. First, intersecting light beams do not interfere, in contrast to electrical conductors, which short when they come into contact. Second, light can operate in high temperature and high radiation environments far outside the capability of solid state electronic components. This actuation method is demonstrated, both in air and in vacuum, by switching the state of a bistable MEMS device.

<doc><title>Real-time quasi-2-D inversion of array resistivity logging data using neural network array tool via dimensional reduction and neural network simulation. Using reciprocity and superposition, we apply a numerical focusing technique to the unfocused data. The numerically focused data are much less subject to 2-D and layering effects and can be approximated as from a cylindrical 1-D Earth. We then perform 1-D inversion on the focused data to provide approximate information about the 2-D resistivity structure. A neural network is used to perform forward modeling in the 1-D inversion, which is several hundred times faster than conventional numerical forward solutions. Testing our inversion algorithm on both synthetic and field data shows that this fast inversion algorithm is useful for providing formation resistivity information at a well site</title><text>We present a quasi-2-D real-time inversion algorithm for a modern galvanic</text><keywords>real-time quasi-2-D inversion;array resistivity logging data;neural network;real-time inversion algorithm;dimensional reduction;reciprocity;superposition;numerical focusing technique;unfocused data;1-D inversion;focused data;forward modeling;formation resistivity;well site</keywords></doc>

The LCS problem is that of finding an LCS of two given strings and the length of the LCS. This problem has been the subject of much research because its solution can be applied in many areas. In this paper, a scalable and efficient systolic algorithm is presented. For two given strings of length m and n, where m>or=n, the algorithm can solve the LCS problem in m+2r-1 (respectively n+2r-1) time steps with r<n/2 (respectively r<m/2) processors.

An assumption which might be questionable at least for the decisions of a given judge. In paired comparison studies, a judge chooses among objects several times, and in such cases, judgements made by the same judge are likely to be dependent. A log-linear representation for the Bradley-Terry model is developed, which takes into account dependencies between judgements. The modelling of the dependencies is embedded in the analysis of multiple binomial responses, which has the advantage of interpretability in terms of conditional odds ratios. Furthermore, the modelling is done in the framework of generalized linear models, thus parameter estimation and the assessment of goodness of fit can be obtained in the standard way by using e.g. GLIM or another standard software</title><text>In many Bradley-Terry models a more or less explicit assumption is that all</text><keywords>log-linear approach;Bradley-Terry model;multiple binomial responses;conditional odds ratios;generalized linear models;parameter estimation;goodness of fit;GLIM</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>FLID-DL: congestion control for layered multicast new multirate congestion control algorithm for layered multicast sessions. FLID-DL generalizes the receiver-driven layered congestion control protocol (RLC) introduced by Vicisano et al. (Proc. IEEE INFOCOM, San Francisco, CA, , p.996-1003, Mar. 1998)ameliorating the problems associated with large Internet group management protocol (IGMP) leave latencies and abrupt rate increases. Like RLC, FLID-DL, is a scalable, receiver-driven congestion control mechanism in which receivers add layers at sender-initiated synchronization points and leave layers when they experience congestion. FLID-DL congestion control coexists with transmission control protocol (TCP) flows as well as other FLID-DL sessions and supports general rates on the different multicast layers. We demonstrate via simulations that our congestion control scheme exhibits better fairness properties and provides better throughput than previous methods. A key contribution that enables FLID-DL and may be useful elsewhere is dynamic layering (DL), which mitigates the negative impact of long IGMP leave latencies and eliminates the need for probe intervals present in RLC. We use DL to respond to congestion much faster than IGMP leave operations, which have proven to be a bottleneck in practice for prior work</title><text>We describe fair layered increase/decrease with dynamic layering (FLID-DL): a</text><keywords>FLID-DL;congestion control;fair layered increase/decrease with dynamic layering;multirate congestion control algorithm;layered multicast sessions;receiver-driven layered congestion control protocol;Internet group management protocol;IGMP;transmission control protocol;sender-initiated synchronization;multicast layers;simulations;throughput;dynamic layering</keywords></doc>

We present a brief overview of interval Taylor series (ITS) methods for IVPs for ODEs and discuss some recent advances in the theory of validated methods for IVPs for ODEs. In particular, we discuss an interval Hermite-Obreschkoff (IHO) scheme for computing rigorous bounds on the solution of an IVP for an ODE, the stability of ITS and IHO methods, and a new perspective on the wrapping effect, where we interpret the problem of reducing the wrapping effect as one of finding a more stable scheme for advancing the solution</title><text>Compared to standard numerical methods for initial value problems (IVPs) for</text><keywords>validated methods;initial value problems;ordinary differential equations;interval methods;interval Taylor series;wrapping effect</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>Design and manufacture of a lightweight piezo-composite curved actuator test of a lightweight piezo-composite curved actuator (called LIPCA) using a top carbon fiber composite layer with near-zero coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), a middle PZT ceramic wafer, and a bottom glass/epoxy layer with a high CTE. The main point of the design for LIPCA is to replace the heavy metal layers of THUNDER TM by lightweight fiber reinforced plastic layers without losing the capabilities for generating high force and large displacement. It is possible to save up to about 40% of the weight if we replace the metallic backing material by the light fiber composite layer. We can also have design flexibility by selecting the fiber direction and the size of prepreg layers. In addition to the lightweight advantage and design flexibility, the proposed device can be manufactured without adhesive layers when we use an epoxy resin prepreg system. Glass/epoxy prepregs, a ceramic wafer with electrode surfaces, and a carbon prepreg were simply stacked and cured at an elevated temperature (177 degrees C) after following an autoclave bagging process. We found that the manufactured composite laminate device had a sufficient curvature after being detached from a flat mould. An analysis method using the classical lamination theory is presented to predict the curvature of LIPCA after curing at an elevated temperature. The predicted curvatures are in quite good agreement with the experimental values. In order to investigate the merits of LIPCA, performance tests of both LIPCA and THUNDER TM have been conducted under the same boundary conditions. From the experimental actuation tests, it was observed that the developed actuator could generate larger actuation displacement than THUNDER TM</title><text>In this paper we are concerned with the design, manufacture and performance</text><keywords>performance test;lightweight piezo-composite curved actuator;LIPCA;carbon fiber composite layer;near-zero coefficient of thermal expansion;PZT ceramic wafer;glass/epoxy layer;fiber reinforced plastic layers;predicted curvatures;performance tests;boundary conditions;THUNDER</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>A maximum-likelihood surface estimator for dense range data taken from different points of view, i.e., multiple range maps. The proposed method uses a sensor model to develop an expression for the likelihood of a 3D surface, conditional on a set of noisy range measurements. Optimizing this likelihood with respect to the model parameters provides an unbiased and efficient estimator. The proposed numerical algorithms make this estimation computationally practical for a wide variety of circumstances. The results from this method compare favorably with state-of-the-art approaches that rely on the closest-point or perpendicular distance metric, a convenient heuristic that produces biased solutions and fails completely when surfaces are not sufficiently smooth, as in the case of complex scenes or noisy range measurements. Empirical results on both simulated and real ladar data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for several different types of problems. Furthermore, the proposed method offers a general framework that can accommodate extensions to include surface priors, more sophisticated noise models, and other sensing modalities, such as sonar or synthetic aperture radar</title><text>Describes how to estimate 3D surface models from dense sets of noisy range data</text><keywords>maximum-likelihood surface estimator;dense range data;3D surface models;noisy range data;sensor model;heuristic;biased solutions;complex scenes;noisy range measurements;real ladar data;sonar;synthetic aperture radar</keywords></doc>

Lightweight, inflatable structures are very attractive in satellite applications. However, the lightweight, flexible and highly damped nature of inflated structures poses difficulties in ground vibration testing. In this study, we show that polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) patches and recently developed macro-fiber composite actuators may be used as sensors and actuators in identifying modal parameters. Both smart materials can be integrated unobtrusively into the skin of a torus or space device forming an attractive testing arrangement. The addition of actuators and PVDF sensors to the torus does not significantly interfere with the suspension modes of a free-free boundary condition, and can be considered an integral part of the inflated structure.

Analytical study and numerical computation of such solutions are very difficult and far from complete when only techniques from control theory are used. This paper solves optimal control problems by reducing them to the combinatorial search for the shortest path in a specially constructed graph. Since the nodes of the graph are weighted in a sequence-dependent manner, we extend the classical, shortest-path algorithm to our case. The proposed solution method is currently limited to single-state problems with multiple control functions.

<doc><title>Elastically adaptive deformable models elastic parameters within a Kalman filter framework for shape estimation applications. The novelty of the technique is that the model's elastic parameters are not constant, but spatio-temporally varying. The variation of the elastic parameters depends on the distance of the model from the data and the rate of change of this distance. Each pass of the algorithm uses physics-based modeling techniques to iteratively adjust both the geometric and the elastic degrees of freedom of the model in response to forces that are computed from the discrepancy between the model and the data. By augmenting the state equations of an extended Kalman filter to incorporate these additional variables, we are able to significantly improve the quality of the shape estimation. Therefore, the model's elastic parameters are always initialized to the same value and they are subsequently modified depending on the data and the noise distribution. We present results demonstrating the effectiveness of our method for both two-dimensional and three-dimensional data</title><text>We present a technique for the automatic adaptation of a deformable model's</text><keywords>elastically adaptive deformable models;automatic adaptation;elastic parameters;Kalman filter framework;shape estimation;physics-based modeling techniques;elastic degrees of freedom;state equations;extended Kalman filter</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>Dynamic spectrum management for next-generation DSL systems electromagnetic coupling among the multiple twisted pairs making up a phone cable. In order to reduce performance loss arising from crosstalk, DSL systems are currently designed under the assumption of worst-case crosstalk scenarios leading to overly conservative DSL deployments. This article presents a new paradigm for DSL system design, which takes into account the multi-user aspects of the DSL transmission environment. Dynamic spectrum management (DSM) departs from the current design philosophy by enabling transceivers to autonomously and dynamically optimize their communication settings with respect to both the channel and the transmissions of neighboring systems. Along with this distributed optimization, when an additional degree of coordination becomes available for future DSL deployment, DSM will allow even greater improvement in DSL performance. Implementations are readily applicable without causing any performance degradation to the existing DSLs under static spectrum management. After providing an overview of the DSM concept, this article reviews two practical DSM methods: iterative water-filling, an autonomous distributed power control method enabling great improvement in performance, which can be implemented through software options in some existing ADSL and VDSL systems; and vectored-DMT, a coordinated transmission/reception technique achieving crosstalk-free communication for DSL systems, which brings within reach the dream of providing universal Internet access at speeds close to 100 Mb/s to 500 m on 1-2 lines and beyond 1 km on 2-4 lines.

<doc><title>Upper bound analysis of oblique cutting with nose radius tools cutting using flat-faced nose radius tools is described. The projection of the uncut chip area on the rake face is divided into a number of elements parallel to an assumed chip flow direction. The length of each of these elements is used to find the length of the corresponding element on the shear surface using the ratio of the shear velocity to the chip velocity. The area of each element is found as the cross product of the length and its width along the cutting edge. Summing up the area of the elements along the shear surface, the total shear surface area is obtained. The friction area is calculated using the similarity between orthogonal and oblique cutting in the 'equivalent' plane that includes both the cutting velocity and chip velocity. The cutting power is obtained by summing the shear power and the friction power. The actual chip flow angle and chip velocity are obtained by minimizing the cutting power with respect to both these variables.

Owing to the difficulty of the resulting arc-routing problems, effective local search heuristics are developed. Computational speed becomes important because robot arc welding is often part of an automated process-planning procedure. Generating a reasonable solution in an acceptable time is necessary for effective automated process planning. Several different heuristics are proposed for solving the welding task-sequencing problem considering both productivity and the potential for welding distortion.

For the maximal cut problem, the proposed algorithm employs an auxiliary Bernoulli distribution, which transforms the original deterministic network into an associated stochastic one, called the associated stochastic network (ASN). Each iteration of the randomized algorithm for the ASN involves the following two phases: (1) generation of random cuts using a multidimensional Ber(p) distribution and calculation of the associated cut lengths (objective functions) and some related quantities, such as rare-event probabilities; (2) updating the parameter vector p on the basis of the data collected in the first phase. We show that the Ber(p) distribution converges in distribution to a degenerated one, Ber(p/sub d/*), p/sub d/* = (p/sub d/,/sub 1/, p/sub d,n/) in the sense that some elements of p/sub d/*, will be unities and the rest zeros. The unity elements of p/sub d/* uniquely define a cut which will be taken as the estimate of the maximal cut. A similar approach is used for the partition problem. Supporting numerical results are given as well. Our numerical studies suggest that for the maximal cut and partition problems the proposed algorithm typically has polynomial complexity in the size of the network</title><text>We show how to solve the maximal cut and partition problems using a randomized</text><keywords>Bernoulli distribution;deterministic network;associated stochastic network;random cuts;probability;numerical results;polynomial complexity;maximal cut problems;partition problems;randomized algorithm</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>Estimation of blocking probabilities in cellular networks with dynamic channel assignment channel assignment are hard to compute for realistic sized systems. This computational difficulty is due to the structure of the state space, which imposes strong coupling constraints amongst components of the occupancy vector. Approximate tractable models have been proposed, which have product form stationary state distributions. However, for real channel assignment schemes, the product form is a poor approximation and it is necessary to simulate the actual occupancy process in order to estimate the blocking probabilities. Meaningful estimates of the blocking probability typically require an enormous amount of CPU time for simulation, since blocking events are usually rare. Advanced simulation approaches use importance sampling (IS) to overcome this problem. We study two regimes under which blocking is a rare event: low-load and high cell capacity. Our simulations use the standard clock (SC) method. For low load, we propose a change of measure that we call static ISSC, which has bounded relative error. For high capacity, we use a change of measure that depends on the current state of the network occupancy. This is the dynamic ISSC method. We prove that this method yields zero variance estimators for single clique models, and we empirically show the advantages of this method over naive simulation for networks of moderate size and traffic loads</title><text>Blocking probabilities in cellular mobile communication networks using dynamic</text><keywords>dynamic channel assignment;cellular mobile communication networks;strong coupling constraints;occupancy vector;approximate tractable models;product form stationary state distributions;CPU time;simulation;importance sampling;low-load;high cell capacity;bounded relative error;dynamic ISSC method;zero variance estimators;single clique models</keywords></doc>
<doc><title>Computing transient gating charge movement of voltage-dependent ion channels steep relationship with voltage. In response to changes in the transmembrane voltage, structural movements of an ion channel that precede channel opening generate a capacitative gating current. The net gating charge displacement due to membrane depolarization is an index of the voltage sensitivity of the ion channel activation process. Understanding the molecular basis of voltage-dependent gating of ion channels requires the measurement and computation of the gating charge, Q. We derive a simple and accurate semianalytic approach to computing the voltage dependence of transient gating charge movement (Q-V relationship) of discrete Markov state models of ion channels using matrix methods. This approach allows rapid computation of Q-V curves for finite and infinite length step depolarizations and is consistent with experimentally measured transient gating charge. This computational approach was applied to Shaker potassium channel gating, including the impact of inactivating particles on potassium channel gating currents</title><text>The opening of voltage-gated sodium, potassium, and calcium ion channels has a</text><keywords>transient gating charge movement;transmembrane voltage;gating current;ion channels;charge movement;Markov state model</keywords></doc>

An active robot finger 10 mm in outer diameter with a shape memory alloy (SMA) wire actuator embedded in the finger with a constant distance from the geometric centre of the finger was designed and fabricated. The practical specifications of the SMA wire and the flexible rod were determined on the basis of a series of formulae. The active finger consists of two bending parts, the SMA actuators and a connecting part. The mechanical properties of the bending part are investigated.

<doc><title>Achieving performance under OpenMP on ccNUMA and software distributed shared memory systems parallel systems. It was conceived to enable easy, portable application development on this range of systems, and it has also been implemented on cache-coherent Non-Uniform Memory Access (ccNUMA) architectures. Unfortunately, it is hard to obtain high performance on the latter architecture, particularly when large numbers of threads are involved. In this paper, we discuss the difficulties faced when writing OpenMP programs for ccNUMA systems, and explain how the vendors have attempted to overcome them. We focus on one such system, the SGI Origin 2000, and perform a variety of experiments designed to illustrate the impact of the vendor's efforts. We compare codes written in a standard, loop-level parallel style under OpenMP with alternative versions written in a Single Program Multiple Data (SPMD) fashion, also realized via OpenMP, and show that the latter consistently provides superior performance. A carefully chosen set of language extensions can help us translate programs from the former style to the latter (or to compile directly, but in a similar manner). Syntax for these extensions can be borrowed from HPF, and some aspects of HPF compiler technology can help the translation process. It is our expectation that an extended language, if well compiled, would improve the attractiveness of OpenMP as a language for high-performance computation on an important class of modern architectures</title><text>OpenMP is emerging as a viable high-level programming model for shared memory</text><keywords>cache-coherent Non-Uniform Memory Access;OpenMP;programming model;HPF;Single Program Multiple Data</keywords></doc>

Action psychologists, in contrast, study post-decision issues, investigating how decisions, once formed, are maintained, protected, and enacted. Through the research presented here, we seek to bridge these two disciplines, proposing that the process by which decisions are reached motivates subsequent pursuit and benefits eventual realization. We identify three characteristics of the decision process (DP) as having motivation-mustering potential: DP effort investment, DP importance, and DP confidence. Through two field studies tracking participants' decision processes, pursuit and realization, we find that after controlling for the influence of the motivational mechanisms of goal intention and implementation intention, the three decision process characteristics significantly influence the successful enactment of the chosen decision directly.

We investigate the possibility of using such a convolution to approximate a given convolution (in practice an image blur). Then we use these approximations to deblur images. First, we show that this framework permits us to redefine existing deblurring methods. Then, we show that it permits us to define a new variational method which combines the wavelet packet and the total variation approaches. We argue and show by experiments that this permits us to avoid the drawbacks of both approaches which are, respectively, ringing and staircasing</title><text>We show that the average over translations of an operator diagonal in a wavelet</text><keywords>image deblurring;wavelet packet bases;convolution;operator diagonal;total variation approach;ringing;staircasing</keywords></doc>

Despite this trend, performance analysis and tuning tools are still not used regularly by algorithm and application designers. To a large extent, existing performance tools fail to meet many user needs and are cumbersome to use. To address these issues, we developed HPCVIEW - a toolkit for combining multiple sets of program profile data, correlating the data with source code, and generating a database that can be analyzed anywhere with a commodity Web browser. We argue that HPCVIEW addresses many of the issues that have limited the usability and the utility of most existing tools. We originally built HPCVIEW to facilitate our own work on data layout and optimizing compilers.

Experiments have been conducted on stainless steel workpieces and a comparison was made between stainless steel and mild steel. The central composite design was employed to plan the experiments in order to achieve required information with reduced number of experiments. The process performance was evaluated. The ratio of minimum to maximum Feret's diameter was considered as circularity characteristic of the hole. The models of these three process characteristics were developed by linear multiple regression technique. The significant coefficients were obtained by performing analysis of variance (ANOVA) at 1, 5 and 7% levels of significance. The final models were checked by complete residual analysis and finally were experimentally verified. It was found that the pulse frequency had a significant effect on the hole entrance diameter and hole circularity in drilling stainless steel unlike the drilling of mild steel where the pulse frequency had no significant effect on the hole characteristics</title><text>Investigates the relationships and parameter interactions between six</text><keywords>comparative statistical analysis;hole taper;circularity;laser percussion drilling;stainless steel workpieces;mild steel;pulse frequency;central composite design;process performance;linear multiple regression technique;analysis of variance;ANOVA;complete residual analysis</keywords></doc>

The female binge eating disorder (BED) patients (n=20), involved in a residential weight control treatment including low-calorie diet (1200 cal/day) and physical training, were randomly assigned either to the multidimensional VR treatment or to psychonutritional groups based on the cognitive-behavior approach. Patients were administered a battery of outcome measures assessing eating disorders symptomathology, attitudes toward food, body dissatisfaction, level of anxiety, motivation for change, level of assertiveness, and general psychiatric symptoms. In the short term, the VR treatment was more effective than the traditional cognitive-behavioral psychonutritional groups in improving the overall psychological state of the patients. In particular, the therapy was more effective in improving body satisfaction, self-efficacy, and motivation for change. No significant differences were found in the reduction of the binge eating behavior. The possibility of inducing a significant change in body image and its associated behaviors using a VR-based short-term therapy can be useful to improve the body satisfaction in traditional weight reduction programs.

We used a computational model of the blood flow in a vessel with a blunt stenosis and an autoregulated vascular bed to simulate a stenosed blood vessel. A key point in creating realistic simulations is to properly model arterial autoregulation. A constant flow regulation mechanism resulted in CFR and FFR values that were within the physiological range, while a constant wall-shear stress model yielded unrealistic values.

An optimum weighting function for the memory registers is theoretically derived. The optimum time-dependent weighting function allows sorting and clustering of the randomly distributed objects in the shortest time. By maximizing the average speed of a texture feature (the contrast) we check the central assumption, the intermediate steady-states hypothesis, of our theoretical result.

The rapid expansion of electronic commerce programmes raises the question of what actually is being taught. The association of electronic commerce as primarily a technical or information technology (IT) phenomenon has not been sufficient to constrain it to IT and information systems departments. Business schools have been keen entrants into the electronic commerce coursework race and they are developing electronic commerce programmes in an environment where there is no agreed definition of the term. This paper draws on the work of Kenneth Boulding who argued that the dynamics of change in society are largely a product of changing skills and the way these skills are arranged into roles at the organizational level. It is argued that an overly technical interpretation of electronic commerce narrows the skills being acquired as part of formal education. Universities, under pressure from the market and technological change, are changing their roles resulting in a further narrowing of the breadth of issues that is seen as legitimate to be included as electronic commerce. The outcome is that aspiring electronic commerce professionals are not being exposed to a wide enough agenda of ideas and concepts that will assist them to make better business decisions</title><text>The teaching of electronic commerce in universities has become a growth</text><keywords>electronic commerce professionals;universities;information technology;IT;information systems;business schools;organizational level;formal education;Kenneth Boulding</keywords></doc>

Here, applications arrange themselves in a logical overlay network and transfer data within the overlay. We present an application-layer multicast solution that uses a Delaunay triangulation as an overlay network topology. An advantage of using a Delaunay triangulation is that it allows each application to locally derive next-hop routing information without requiring a routing protocol in the overlay. A disadvantage of using a Delaunay triangulation is that the mapping of the overlay to the network topology at the network and data link layer may be suboptimal. We present a protocol, called Delaunay triangulation (DT protocol), which constructs Delaunay triangulation overlay networks. We present measurement experiments of the DT protocol for overlay networks with up to 10 000 members, that are running on a local PC cluster with 100 Linux PCs. The results show that the protocol stabilizes quickly, e.g., an overlay network with 10 000 nodes can be built in just over 30 s. The traffic measurements indicate that the average overhead of a node is only a few kilobits per second if the overlay network is in a steady state. Results of throughput experiments of multicast transmissions (using TCP unicast connections between neighbors in the overlay network) show an achievable throughput of approximately 15 Mb/s in an overlay with 100 nodes and 2 Mb/s in an overlay with 1000 nodes</title><text>Application-layer multicast supports group applications without the need for a</text><keywords>application-layer multicasting;Delaunay triangulation overlays;group applications;network-layer multicast protocol;logical overlay network;measurement experiments;overlay networks;local PC cluster;Linux PC;overlay network topology;next-hop routing information;data link layer;DT protocol;traffic measurements;average overhead;throughput experiments;multicast transmissions;TCP unicast connections</keywords></doc>

In addition, we emphasize the importance of building a strong theoretical foundation and using it to guide future empirical work in this area</title><text>This study reviews and synthesizes human factors research on conceptual data</text><keywords>human factors;future efforts;Analyst Developer models;User-Analyst models</keywords></doc>
<doc><title>Vibration control of the rotating flexible-shaft/multi-flexible-disk system with the eddy-current damper system is formulated by applying the assumed-mode method into the kinetic and strain energies, and the virtual work done by the eddy-current damper. From Lagrange's equations, the resulting discretized equations of motion can be simplified as a bilinear system (BLS). Introducing the control laws, including the quadratic, nonlinear and optimal feedback control laws, into the BLS, it is found that the eddy-current damper can be used to suppress flexible and shear vibrations simultaneously, and the system is globally asymptotically stable. Numerical results are provided to validate the theoretical analysis</title><text>In this paper, the rotating flexible-Timoshenko-shaft/flexible-disk coupling</text><keywords>rotating flexible-shaft/multi-flexible-disk system;eddy-current damper;assumed-mode method;virtual work;Lagrange's equations;discretized equations of motion;bilinear system;optimal feedback control laws;shear vibrations</keywords></doc>
<doc><title>An effective feedback control mechanism for DiffServ architecture Service) mainly consists of two components: traffic conditioning at the edge of the Diffserv domain and simple packet forwarding inside the DiffServ domain. DiffServ has many advantages such as flexibility, scalability and simplicity. But when providing AF (Assured Forwarding) services, DiffServ has some problems such as unfairness among aggregated flows or among micro-flows belonging to an aggregated flow. In this paper, a feedback mechanism for AF aggregated flows is proposed to solve this problem. Simulation results show that this mechanism does improve the performance of DiffServ. First, it can improve the fairness among aggregated flows and make DiffServ more friendly toward TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) flows. Second, it can decrease the buffer requirements at the congested router and thus obtain lower delay and packet loss rate. Third, it also keeps almost the same link utility as in normal DiffServ. Finally, it is simple and easy to be implemented</title><text>As a scalable QoS (Quality of Service) architecture, Diffserv (Differentiated</text><keywords>QoS;Diffserv;traffic conditioning;packet forwarding;AF;feedback mechanism;fairness;TCP;feedback control</keywords></doc>

The matrices specifying the resulting semidiscrete problem are proved to satisfy a sectorial resolvent condition, uniformly with respect to the discretization parameter. Using this resolvent condition, unconditional stability is proved for the fully discrete numerical process generated by applying A( theta )-stable one-step methods to the semidiscrete problem. This stability result is established in the maximum norm; it improves some previous results in the literature in that it is not subject to various unnatural restrictions which were imposed on the boundary conditions and on the one-step methods</title><text>This paper deals with numerical methods for the solution of the heat equation</text><keywords>numerical solution;heat equation;nonlocal boundary conditions;stability;integral boundary conditions;finite differences;matrices;semidiscrete problem;sectorial resolvent condition;fully discrete numerical process;one-step methods;maximum norm</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>Experimental investigations on monitoring and control of induction heating process for semi-solid alloys using the heating coil as sensor control of the heating process utilizing the heating coil itself as a sensor is proposed, and its usefulness and effectiveness were experimentally investigated using aluminium A357 billets for the semi-solid metal (SSM) casting processes. The impedance of the coil containing the billet was continuously measured by the proposed method in the temperature range between room temperature and 700 degrees C. It was found that the reactance component of the impedance varied distinctively according to the billet state and could clearly monitor the deformation of the billet, while the resistance component increased with temperature, reflecting the variation of the resistivity of the billet which has strong correlation to the solid/liquid fraction of the billets. The measured impedance is very sensitive to the billet states such as temperature, deformation and solid/liquid fraction and could be used as a parameter to monitor and control the heating process for SSMs</title><text>A method of monitoring the state of metal alloys during induction heating and</text><keywords>induction heating process;reactance component;billet state;resistance component;solid/liquid fraction</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>Contrast sensitivity in a dynamic environment: effects of target conditions and visual impairment -120 degrees /s) over a variety of viewing conditions. In Experiment 1, measurements of dynamic contrast sensitivity were determined for observers as a function of target velocity for letter stimuli. Significant main effects were found for target velocity, target size, and target duration, but significant interactions among the variables indicated especially pronounced adverse effects of increasing target velocity for small targets and brief durations. In Experiment 2, the effects of simulated cataracts were determined. Although the simulated impairment had no effect on traditional acuity scores, dynamic contrast sensitivity was markedly reduced. Results are discussed in terms of dynamic contrast sensitivity as a useful composite measure of visual functioning that may provide a better overall picture of an individual's visual functioning than does traditional static acuity, dynamic acuity, or contrast sensitivity alone. The measure of dynamic contrast sensitivity may increase understanding of the practical effects of various conditions, such as aging or disease, on the visual system, or it may allow improved prediction of individuals' performance in visually dynamic situations</title><text>Contrast sensitivity was determined as a function of target velocity (0 degrees</text><keywords>contrast sensitivity;dynamic environment;target conditions;visual impairment;dynamic contrast sensitivity;target velocity;target size;target duration;acuity scores;aging;disease</keywords></doc>

The hodographs of such curves correspond to certain combinations of four polynomials, given by Dietz et al. (1993), that admit compact descriptions in terms of quaternions - an instance of the "PH representation map" proposed by Choi et al. (2002). The lowest-order PH curves that interpolate arbitrary first-order spatial Hermite data are quintics. It is shown that, with PH quintics, the quaternion representation yields a reduction of the Hermite interpolation problem to three "simple" quadratic equations in three quaternion unknowns. This system admits a closed-form solution, expressing all PH quintic interpolants to given spatial Hermite data as a two-parameter family. An integral shape measure is invoked to fix these two free parameters</title><text>The interpolation of first-order Hermite data by spatial Pythagorean-hodograph</text><keywords>interpolation;first-order Hermite data;quaternions;polynomials;closed-form solution;integral shape measure</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>Linear, parameter-varying control and its application to a turbofan engine to a turbofan engine. Parameter-dependent systems are linear systems, whose state-space descriptions are known functions of time-varying parameters. The time variation of each of the parameters is not known in advance, but is assumed to be measurable in real-time. Three linear, parameter-varying (LPV) approaches to control design are discussed. The first method is based on linear fractional transformations which relies on the small gain theorem for bounds on performance and robustness. The other methods make use of either a single (SQLF) or parameter-dependent (PDQLF) quadratic Lyapunov function to bound the achievable level of performance. The latter two techniques are used to synthesize controllers for a high-performance turbofan engine. A LPV model of the turbofan engine is constructed from Jacobian linearizations at fixed power codes for control design. The control problem is formulated as a model matching problem in the H/sub infinity / and LPV framework. The objective is decoupled command response of the closed-loop system to pressure and rotor speed requests. The performance of linear, H/sub infinity / point designs are compared with the SQLF and PDQLF controllers. Nonlinear simulations indicate that the controller synthesized using the SQLF approach is slightly more conservative than the PDQLF controller. Nonlinear simulations with the SQLF and PDQLF controllers show very robust designs that achieve all desired performance objectives</title><text>This paper describes application of parameter-dependent control design methods</text><keywords>turbofan engine;parameter-dependent control design methods;state-space descriptions;time-varying parameters;linear fractional transformations;small gain theorem;Jacobian linearizations;decoupled command response;closed-loop system;model matching problem;nonlinear simulations;very robust designs</keywords></doc>

We consider a given minimization problem P, for which a unique solution will be a point delta on the Bezier curve. For the minimization function f, two sufficient conditions exist that ensure the uniqueness of the solution, namely, the concavity of the control polygon of the polynomial and the characteristics of the Polya frequency-control polygon where the minimum coincides with a critical point of the polynomial. The use of the blossoming theory provides us with a useful geometrical interpretation of the minimization problem. In addition, this minimization approach leads us to a new method of discovering inequalities about the elementary symmetric polynomials</title><text>In this paper, we show that there exists a close dependence between the control</text><keywords>control polygon;polynomial;symmetric linear constraints;Bezier curve;concavity;Polya frequency-control polygon;critical point;geometrical interpretation;inequalities;elementary symmetric polynomials</keywords></doc>
<doc><title>Estimation of the gradient of the solution of an adjoint diffusion equation by the Monte Carlo method weighted concentration of trajectories and its space derivatives in the form of integrals (with some weights) of the solution to the corresponding boundary value problem and its directional derivative of a convective velocity. If the convective velocity at the domain boundary is degenerate and some other additional conditions are imposed this representation allows us to construct an efficient 'random walk by spheres and balls' algorithm. When these conditions are violated, transition to modelling the diffusion trajectories by the Euler scheme is realized, and the directional derivative of velocity is estimated by the dependent testing method, using the parallel modelling of two closely-spaced diffusion trajectories. We succeeded in justifying this method by statistically equivalent transition to modelling a single trajectory after the first step in the Euler scheme, using a suitable weight. This weight also admits direct differentiation with respect to the initial coordinate along a given direction. The resulting weight algorithm for calculating concentration derivatives is especially efficient if the initial point is in the subdomain in which the coefficients of the diffusion equation are constant</title><text>For the case of isotropic diffusion we consider the representation of the</text><keywords>isotropic diffusion;space derivatives;integrals;boundary value problem;directional derivative;convective velocity;domain boundary;adjoint diffusion equation;Monte Carlo method;diffusion trajectories;Euler scheme;dependent testing method;parallel modelling;closely-spaced diffusion trajectories;statistically equivalent transition;weight;direct differentiation;initial coordinate;concentration derivatives</keywords></doc>
<doc><title>The development of CASC [automated theorem proving] that an advance really does have general, overall positive consequences for system performance. For this it is necessary to evaluate the system on a set of problems that is sufficiently large and diverse to be somehow representative of the intended application area as a whole. It is only a small step from system evaluation to a communal system competition. The CADE ATP System Competition (CASC) has been run annually since 1996. Any competition is difficult to design and organize in the first instance, and to then run over the years. In order to obtain the full benefits of a competition, a thoroughly organized event, with an unambiguous and motivated design, is necessary. For some issues relevant to the CASC design, inevitable constraints have emerged. For other issues there have been several choices, and decisions have had to be made.

<doc><title>Computational complexity of probabilistic disambiguation dealing with the ambiguity of formal grammars. In this approach, statistics, concerning the various linguistic phenomena of interest, are gathered from actual linguistic data and used to estimate the probabilities of the various entities that are generated by a given grammar, e.g., derivations, parse-trees and sentences. The extension of grammars with probabilities makes it possible to state ambiguity resolution as a constrained optimization formula, which aims at maximizing the probability of some entity that the grammar generates given the input (e.g., maximum probability parse-tree given some input sentence). The implementation of these optimization formulae in efficient algorithms, however, does not always proceed smoothly. In this paper, we address the computational complexity of ambiguity resolution under various kinds of probabilistic models. We provide proofs that some, frequently occurring problems of ambiguity resolution are NP-complete. These problems are encountered in various applications, e.g., language understanding for textand speech-based applications. Assuming the common model of computation, this result implies that, for many existing probabilistic models it is not possible to devise tractable algorithms for solving these optimization problems</title><text>Recent models of natural language processing employ statistical reasoning for</text><keywords>natural language processing;statistical reasoning;formal grammars;statistics;computational complexity;probabilistic disambiguation;state ambiguity resolution;constrained optimization formula;probabilistic models;language understanding</keywords></doc>

Rubinfeld and Sudan introduced the notion of property testers, probabilistic algorithms that can decide, with high probability, if a function has a certain property or if it is far from any function having this property. Goldreich, Goldwasser, and Ron constructed property testers with constant query complexity for dense instances of a large class of graph problems. Since many graph problems can be viewed as special cases of the Constraint Satisfaction Problem on Boolean domains, it is natural to try to construct property testers for more general cases of the Constraint Satisfaction Problem. In this paper, we give explicit constructions of property testers using a constant number of queries for dense instances of Constraint Satisfaction Problems where the constraints have constant arity and the variables assume values in some domain of finite size</title><text>Many NP-hard languages can be "decided" in subexponential time if the</text><keywords>NP-hard languages;property testers;probabilistic algorithms;constant query complexity;constraint satisfaction;dense instances;subexponential time;graph problems;Constraint Satisfaction Problem</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>GK-DEVS: Geometric and kinematic DEVS formalism for simulation modeling of 3-dimensional multi-component systems (discrete event system specification) formalism is presented in this paper that satisfies the simulation requirements of 3-dimensional and dynamic systems with multi-components. We propose a geometric and kinematic DEVS (GK-DEVS) formalism that is able to describe the geometric and kinematic structure of a system and its continuous state dynamics as well as the interaction among the multi-components. To establish one model having dynamic behavior and a particular hierarchical structure, the atomic and the coupled model of the conventional DEVS are merged into one model in the proposed formalism. For simulation of the continuous motion of 3-D components, the sequential state set is partitioned into the discrete and the continuous state set and the rate of change function over the continuous state set is employed. Although modified from the conventional DEVS formalism, the GK-DEVS formalism preserves a hierarchical, modular modeling fashion and a coupling scheme. Furthermore, for the GK-DEVS model simulation, we propose an abstract simulation algorithm, called a GK-Simulator, in which data and control are separated and events are scheduled not globally but hierarchically so that an object-oriented principle is satisfied. The proposed GK-DEVS formalism and the GK-Simulator algorithm have been applied to the simulation of a flexible manufacturing system consisting of a 2-axis lathe, a 3-axis milling machine, and a vehicle-mounted robot</title><text>A combined discrete/continuous simulation methodology based on the DEVS</text><keywords>GK-DEVS;kinematic DEVS;simulation modeling;combined discrete/continuous simulation methodology;simulation requirements;continuous state dynamics;dynamic behavior;continuous motion;sequential state set;abstract simulation algorithm;GK-Simulator;object-oriented principle;flexible manufacturing system;2-axis lathe;3-axis milling machine;vehicle-mounted robot</keywords></doc>
<doc><title>Closed-loop model set validation under a stochastic framework of a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) plant is described by a model set with unstructured uncertainties, and identification experiments are performed in closed loop. A necessary and sufficient condition has been derived for the consistency of the model set with both the stabilizing controller and closed-loop frequency domain experimental data (FDED). In this condition, only the Euclidean norm of a complex vector is involved, and this complex vector depends linearly on both the disturbances and the measurement errors. Based on this condition, an analytic formula has been derived for the sample unfalsified probability (SUP) of the model set. Some of the asymptotic statistical properties of the SUP have also been briefly discussed. A numerical example is included to illustrate the efficiency of the suggested method in model set quality evaluation</title><text>Deals with probabilistic model set validation.

During a five-month study period, 29 rounds were broadcast (19 in medicine and 10 in cardiology). The total recorded attendance at the remote site was 103, comprising 70 specialists, nine family physicians and 24 other health-care professionals. We received 55 evaluations, a response rate of 53%. On a five-point Likert scale (on which higher scores indicated better quality), mean ratings by remote-site participants of the technical quality of the videoconference were 3.0-3.5, with the lowest ratings being for ability to hear the discussion (3.0) and to see visual aids (3.1). Mean ratings for content, presentation, discussion and educational value were 3.8 or higher. Of the 49 physicians who presented the rounds, we received evaluations from 41, a response rate of 84%. The presenters rated all aspects of the videoconference and interaction with remote sites at 3.8 or lower. The lowest ratings were for ability to see the remote sites (3.0) and the usefulness of the discussion (3.4). We received 278 evaluations from participants at the presenting site, an estimated response rate of about 55%. The results indicated no adverse opinions of the effect of videoconferencing (mean scores 3.1-3.3). The estimated costs of videoconferencing one grand round to one site and four sites were C$723 and C$1515, respectively. The study confirmed that videoconferenced rounds can provide satisfactory continuing medical education to community specialists, which is an especially important consideration as maintenance of certification becomes mandatory</title><text>We evaluated various aspects of grand rounds videoconferenced from a tertiary</text><keywords>videoconferenced grand rounds;regional hospital;cardiology;health-care professionals;five-point Likert scale;remote sites;continuing medical education;certification</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>Generic simulation approach for multi-axis machining. Part 1: modeling methodology machining of complex sculptured surfaces. A generalized approach is developed for representing an arbitrary cutting edge design, and the local surface topology of a complex sculptured surface. A NURBS curve is used to represent the cutting edge profile. This approach offers the advantages of representing any arbitrary cutting edge design in a generic way, as well as providing standardized techniques for manipulating the location and orientation of the cutting edge. The local surface topology of the part is defined as those surfaces generated by previous tool paths in the vicinity of the current tool position. The local surface topology of the part is represented without using a computationally expensive CAD system. A systematic prediction technique is then developed to determine the instantaneous tool/part interaction during machining. The methodology employed here determines the cutting edge in-cut segments by determining the intersection between the NURBS curve representation of the cutting edge and the defined local surface topology. These in-cut segments are then utilized for predicting instantaneous chip load, static and dynamic cutting forces, and tool deflection. Part 1 of this paper details the modeling methodology and demonstrates the capabilities of the simulation for machining a complex surface</title><text>This paper presents a new methodology for analytically simulating multi-axis</text><keywords>complex sculptured surfaces;systematic prediction;cutting edge profile;surface topology;NURBS curve</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>Improving supply-chain performance by sharing advance demand information improve supply-chain performance. We consider two types of ADI, aggregated ADI (A-ADI) and detailed ADI (D-ADI). With A-ADI, customers share with manufacturers information about whether they will place an order for some product in the next time period, but do not share information about which product they will order and which of several potential manufacturers will receive the order. With D-ADI, customers additionally share information about which product they will order, but which manufacturer will receive the order remains uncertain. We develop and solve mathematical models of supply chains where ADI is shared. We derive exact expressions and closed-form approximations for expected costs, expected base-stock levels, and variations of the production quantities. We show that both the manufacturer and the customers benefit from sharing ADI, but that sharing ADI increases the bullwhip effect. We also show that under certain conditions it is optimal to collect ADI from either none or all of the customers. We study two supply chains in detail: a supply chain with an arbitrary number of products that have identical demand rates, and a supply chain with two products that have arbitrary demand rates. For these two supply chains, we analyze how the values of A-ADI and D-ADI depend on the characteristics of the supply chain and on the quality of the shared information, and we identify conditions under which sharing A-ADI and D-ADI can significantly reduce cost. Our results can be used by decision makers to analyze the cost savings that can be achieved by sharing ADI and help them to determine if sharing ADI is beneficial for their supply chains</title><text>In this paper, we analyze how sharing advance demand information (ADI) can</text><keywords>advance demand information;aggregated ADI;detailed ADI;mathematical models;closed-form approximations;expected costs;expected base-stock levels;bullwhip effect;identical demand rates;arbitrary demand rates;decision makers;cost savings</keywords></doc>
<doc><title>Effects of the transition to a client-centred team organization in administrative surveying work Sweden during 1998. The new work organization implied a transition to a client-centred team-based organization and required a change in competence from specialist to generalist knowledge as well as a transition to a new information technology, implying a greater integration within the company. The aim of this study was to follow the surveyors for two years from the start of the transition and investigate how perceived consequences of the transition, job, organizational factors, well-being and effectiveness measures changed between 1998 and 2000. The Teamwork Profile and QPS Nordic questionnaire were used. The 205 surveyors who participated in all three study phases constituted the study group. The result showed that surveyors who perceived that they were working as generalists rated the improvements in job and organizational factors significantly higher than those who perceived that they were not yet generalists. Improvements were noted in 2000 in quality of service to clients, time available to handle a case and effectiveness of teamwork in a transfer to a team-based work organization group, cohesion and continuous improvement practices-for example, learning by doing, mentoring and guided delegation-were important to improve the social effectiveness of group work</title><text>A new work organization was introduced in administrative surveying work in</text><keywords>client-centred team organization;administrative surveying work;information technology;company;job;organizational factors;effectiveness measures;Teamwork Profile;QPS Nordic questionnaire;social effectiveness</keywords></doc>

Drawing from past literature base and based on key tenets of three learning theories - behaviorist, cognitivist, and constructivist - the study first proposes a measurement scheme for "interactivity" and then hypothesizes that "interactivity" would influence the learning outcomes positively in terms of users' learning achievement and attitude. Three prototypes of a multimedia instructional/training system to represent high, low, and noninteractive modes of use were developed and implemented and the hypothesized influences were investigated using a controlled laboratory research design. Multiple analysis of variance (MANOVA) results indicate that while interactivity does not necessarily enable enhanced gain in user learning, it positively influences participants' attitude. The study finds no support for hypothesized moderating effects of learning styles (measured using Kolb's Learning Style Inventory scale) on the relationship between interactivity and user outcomes. The results of this study have important implications for both education and corporations' training efforts and investments.

<doc><title>The perceived utility of human and automated aids in a visual detection task research has found that human operators often underutilize (disuse) and overly rely on (misuse) automated aids (Parasuraman-Riley (1997)). Nearly 275 Cameron University students participated in 1 of 3 experiments performed to examine the effects of perceived utility (Dzindolet et al. (2001)) on automation use in a visual detection task and to compare reliance on automated aids with reliance on humans. Results revealed a bias for human operators to rely on themselves. Although self-report data indicate a bias toward automated aids over human aids, performance data revealed that participants were more likely to disuse automated aids than to disuse human aids. This discrepancy was accounted for by assuming human operators have a "perfect automation" schema. Actual or potential applications of this research include the design of future automated decision aids and training procedures for operators relying on such aids</title><text>Although increases in the use of automation have occurred across society,</text><keywords>automated aids;visual detection task;human operators;automated decision aids;automation</keywords></doc>

Its design philosophy will be discussed thoughtfully with special focus on how to make use of the multimedia and Internet. According to literatures, learning packages are faced to be more effective in delivering teaching material. Researchers indicate that students using a self-paced learning package score higher than in a traditional classroom setting. Moreover, the learning package provides different scenarios for students to explore themselves in a practical environment and is more cost effective and systematic than lectures. Currently, most learning packages in hotel education are not implemented using multimedia with Internet access. Our paper describes a new learning package that fills the gaps. VONNA(HBP) requires participants to investigate operational budgets on various areas such as sales levels, payroll, inventory level, promotion strategies, and facilities planning, etc. Eventually, the students/novices are required to practice their skills in a comprehensive case about a hypothetical hotel. They need to solve managerial problems by a combination of budgetary planning on human resources, staff training programmes, facilities' maintenance and replacement, or promotion schemes.

It has already been shown that such a response is subideal. Hence, it is necessary to quantitatively analyse the achievable specifications and the robust stability regions. The control parameter can be quantitatively determined with a compromise between the disturbance response and the robustness. Four specifications: (normalised) maximum dynamic error, maximum decay rate, (normalised) control action bound and approximate recovery time are used to characterise the step-disturbance response. It is shown that any attempt to obtain a (normalised) dynamic error less than tau /sub m/ is impossible and a sufficient condition on the (relative) gain-uncertainty bound is square root (3)/2</title><text>For part 1, see ibid., p.285-90, (2002).

Also a class of matrices (H-matrices) has been analysed which are data-sparse and allow an approximate matrix arithmetic with almost linear complexity. In particular, the matrix-vector/matrix-matrix product with such matrices as well as the computation of the inverse have linear-logarithmic cost. In this paper, we apply the H-matrix techniques to approximate the exponent of an elliptic operator. Starting with the Dunford-Cauchy representation for the operator exponent, we then discretise the integral by the exponentially convergent quadrature rule involving a short sum of resolvents. The latter are approximated by the H-matrices. Our algorithm inherits a two-level parallelism with respect to both the computation of resolvents and the treatment of different time values.

It also addresses the adequacy of information provided to the user via training materials (e.g., user manual) about the machine's behavior. The essentials of the methodology, which can be automated and applied to the verification of large systems, are illustrated by several examples and through a case study of pilot interaction with an autopilot aboard a modern commercial aircraft.

In 3 method-of-adjustment procedure experiments, 8 participants matched the disparity of a circular probe and a planar stimulus rendered using a single visible edge.

Participants more accurately matched the depth of vertical stimuli than that of horizontal stimuli, consistent with previous studies and existing theory. Participants matched the depth of surfaces with large pixel-to-pixel luminance variations more accurately than they did surfaces with a small pixel-to-pixel luminance variation. Finally, they matched the depth of surfaces with vertical line patterns more accurately than they did surfaces with horizontal-striped texture patterns.

The dynamics of the system are representative of a vertical landing and take off aircraft, such as a Harrier around hover, or a thrust-vectored aircraft such as F18-HARV or X-31 in forward flight. The adopted control methodology is a hybrid of receding horizon techniques and control Lyapunov function (CLF)-based ideas. First, a CLF is generated using quasi-LPV methods and then, by using the CLF as the terminal cost in the receding horizon optimization, stability is guaranteed. The main advantage of this approach is that stability can be guaranteed without imposing constraints in the on-line optimization, allowing the problem to be solved in a more efficient manner. Models of the experimental set-up are obtained for the hover and forward flight modes. Numerical simulations for different time horizons are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the discussed methods. Specifically, it is shown that a mere upper bound on the cost-to-go is not an appropriate choice for a terminal cost, when the horizon length is short. Simulation results are presented using experimentally verified model parameters</title><text>This paper deals with the application of receding horizon methods to hover and</text><keywords>forward flight models;tethered flying wing;Caltech;Harrier around hover;thrust-vectored aircraft;F18-HARV;X-31;receding horizon techniques;quasi-LPV methods;receding horizon optimization;numerical simulations;terminal cost</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>Electromagnetics computations using the MPI parallel implementation of the steepest descent fast multipole method (SDFMM) necessitates the use of fast algorithms but is also greatly enhanced by employing parallelization techniques. The objective of this work is to demonstrate the speedup achieved by the MPI (message passing interface) parallel implementation of the steepest descent fast multipole method (SDFMM). Although this algorithm has already been optimized to take advantage of the structure of the physics of scattering problems, there is still the opportunity to speed up the calculation by dividing tasks into components using multiple processors and solve them in parallel. The SDFMM has three bottlenecks ordered as (1) filling the sparse impedance matrix associated with the near-field method of moments interactions (MoM), (2) the matrix vector multiplications associated with this sparse matrix and (3) the far field interactions associated with the fast multipole method. The parallel implementation task is accomplished using a thirty-one node Intel Pentium Beowulf cluster and is also validated on a 4-processor Alpha workstation. The Beowulf cluster consists of thirty-one nodes of 350 MHz Intel Pentium IIs with 256 MB of RAM and one node of a 4*450 MHz Intel Pentium II Xeon shared memory processor with 2 GB of RAM with all nodes connected to a 100 BaseTX Ethernet network. The Alpha workstation has a maximum of four 667 MHz processors. Our numerical results show significant linear speedup in filling the sparse impedance matrix. Using the 32-processors on the Beowulf cluster lead to a 7.2 overall speedup while a 2.5 overall speedup is gained using the 4-processors on the Alpha workstation</title><text>The computational solution of large-scale linear systems of equations</text><keywords>electromagnetics computations;MPI parallel implementation;steepest descent fast multipole method;large-scale linear systems;fast algorithms;message passing interface;physics;multiple processors;sparse impedance matrix;method of moments;scattering problems;matrix vector multiplications;Intel Pentium Beowulf cluster;4-processor Alpha workstation;Intel Pentium II;RAM;Xeon shared memory processor</keywords></doc>
<doc><title>Modeling undesirable factors in efficiency evaluation making units (DMUs) with multiple performance factors which are grouped into outputs and inputs. Once the efficient frontier is determined, inefficient DMUs can improve their performance to reach the efficient frontier by either increasing their current output levels or decreasing their current input levels. However, both desirable (good) and undesirable (bad) factors may be present. For example, if inefficiency exists in production processes where final products are manufactured with a production of wastes and pollutants, the outputs of wastes and pollutants are undesirable and should be reduced to improve the performance. Using the classification invariance property, we show that the standard DEA model can be used to improve the performance via increasing the desirable outputs and decreasing the undesirable outputs. The method can also be applied to situations when some inputs need to be increased to improve the performance. The linearity and convexity of DEA are preserved through our proposal</title><text>Data envelopment analysis (DEA) measures the relative efficiency of decision</text><keywords>data envelopment analysis;multiple performance factors;efficient frontier;current output levels;current input levels;production processes;wastes;pollutants;classification invariance property;desirable outputs;undesirable outputs;efficiency evaluation</keywords></doc>

The fields of human-computer interaction, interface design, and human factors have made significant contributions to ease of use and are primarily concerned with the interfaces between systems and users, not with the structures that are often more fundamental for designing truly human-centered systems. The emerging paradigm of human-centered computing (HCC)-which has taken many forms-offers a new look at system design. HCC requires more than merely designing an artificial agent to supplement a human agent. The dynamic interactions in a distributed system composed of human and artificial agents-and the context in which the system is situated-are indispensable factors.

<doc><title>Trends in agent communication language software systems. Agents blend many of the traditional properties of AI programs - knowledge-level reasoning, flexibility, proactiveness, goal-directedness, and so forth - with insights gained from distributed software engineering, machine learning, negotiation and teamwork theory, and the social sciences. An important part of the agent approach is the principle that agents (like humans) can function more effectively in groups that are characterized by cooperation and division of labor. Agent programs are designed to autonomously collaborate with each other in order to satisfy both their internal goals and the shared external demands generated by virtue of their participation in agent societies. This type of collaboration depends on a sophisticated system of inter-agent communication. The assumption that inter-agent communication is best handled through the explicit use of an agent communication language (ACL) underlies each of the articles in this special issue.

Hyperbolic polynomial B-splines share most of the properties of B-splines in polynomial space. We give subdivision formulae for this new kind of curve and then prove that they have variation diminishing properties and the control polygons of the subdivisions converge. Hyperbolic polynomial B-splines can handle freeform curves as well as remarkable curves such as the hyperbola and the catenary.

We show how this identification problem can be reduced to a linear regression, and provide compact formulae for the corresponding least mean square and recursive least-squares algorithms. We derive conditions on persistency of excitation in terms of the inputs and scheduling parameter trajectories when the functional dependence is of polynomial type. These conditions have a natural polynomial interpolation interpretation, and do not require the scheduling parameter trajectories to vary slowly.

An undesirable consequence of this is that a minor incident such as a delay in the arrival of a small number of flights can result in a chain reaction of events involving several flights and airports, causing disruption throughout the system. This paper reviews recent literature in the area of recovery from schedule disruptions. First we review how disturbances at a given airport could be handled, including the effects of runways and fixes. Then we study the papers on recovery from airline schedule perturbations, which involve adjustments in flight schedules, aircraft, and crew. The mathematical programming techniques used in ground holding are covered in some detail.

<doc><title>Exploiting structure in quantified formulas obtained by quantifying the variables in a sum of terms." The "sum" can be based on any commutative monoid, the "quantifiers" need only satisfy two simple conditions, and the variables can have any finite domain. This problem is a generalization of the problem "given a sum-of-products of terms, find the value of the sum" studied by R.E. Stearns and H.B. Hunt III (1996). A data structure called a "structure tree" is defined which displays information about "subproblems" that can be solved independently during the process of evaluating the formula. Some formulas have "good" structure trees which enable certain generic algorithms to evaluate the formulas in significantly less time than by brute force evaluation. By "generic algorithm," we mean an algorithm constructed from uninterpreted function symbols, quantifier symbols, and monoid operations. The algebraic nature of the model facilitates a formal treatment of "local reductions" based on the "local replacement" of terms. Such local reductions "preserve formula structure" in the sense that structure trees with nice properties transform into structure trees with similar properties. These local reductions can also be used to transform hierarchical specified problems with useful structure into hierarchically specified problems having similar structure</title><text>We study the computational problem "find the value of the quantified formula</text><keywords>quantified formulas;commutative monoid;data structure;structure tree;generic algorithms;function symbols;quantifier symbols;monoid operations;hierarchically specified problems</keywords></doc>

Virtual teams consist of cooperative relationships supported by information technology to overcome limitations of time and/or location. Virtual teams require their members to rely heavily on the use of information technology and trust in coworkers. This study investigates the impacts that the reliance on information technology (operationalized in our study via the user satisfaction construct) and trust have on the job satisfaction of virtual team members. The study findings reveal that both user satisfaction and trust are positively related to job satisfaction in virtual teams, while system use was not found to play a significant role.

<doc><title>Fast, accurate and stable simulation of power electronic systems using virtual resistors and capacitors of stiffness brought about by the modelling of switches as biresistors i.e. very low turn-on resistance and very high turn-off resistance. The merits and drawbacks of two modelling methods that address this problem are discussed. A modelling solution for ensuring numerically stable, accurate and fast simulation of power electronic systems is proposed. The solution enables easy connectivity between power electronic elements in the simulation model. It involves the modelling of virtual capacitance at switching nodes to soften voltage discontinuity due to the switch current suddenly going to zero. Undesirable ringing effects that may arise due to the interaction between the virtual capacitance and circuit inductance are eliminated by modelling virtual damping resistors in parallel to inductors that are adjacent to switching elements. A midpoint configuration method is also introduced for modelling shunt capacitors. A DC traction system is simulated using this modelling strategy and the results are included. Simulation results obtained using this modelling strategy are validated by comparison with the established mesh analysis technique of modelling. The simulation performance is also compared with the Power System Blockset commercial software</title><text>Simulation of power electronic circuits remains a problem due to the high level</text><keywords>virtual resistors;turn-on resistance;high turn-off resistance;switching nodes;ringing effects;DC traction system;mesh analysis technique</keywords></doc>

In the last group a cardiological diagnosis was confirmed in 60 patients and refuted in 23. Seven patients in whom the telecardiology service failed to detect a cardiac problem were hospitalized in the subsequent 48 h.

There is an increasing dependency on its activities as systems extend beyond supporting the internal efficiency of the organisation to augmenting global performance. The growth of wide and local networks has resulted in communication possibilities that were not possible a few years ago. E-commerce challenges the achievements of the IS/IT function and is very prominent in the globalisation of modern organisations. The complexity and diversity of electronic exchange is also well documented (Hackney et al., 2000). This has a number of impacts on the development and implementation of IS/IT solutions for organisations involved in international trade. It is a conjecture that the IS/IT function is critically important for the alignment of the business to meet the demands of global competition, through building internal marketing strategies and creating knowledge based communities.

<doc><title>Non-linear analysis of nearly saturated porous media: theoretical and numerical formulation undergoing large elastic and plastic deformations is presented. A consistent thermodynamic formulation is proposed for the two-phase mixture problem; thus preserving a straightforward and robust numerical scheme. A novel feature is the specification of the fluid compressibility in terms of a volumetric logarithmic strain, which is energy conjugated to the fluid pressure in the entropy inequality. As a result, the entropy inequality is used to separate three different mechanisms representing the response: effective stress response according to Terzaghi in the solid skeleton, fluid pressure response to compressibility of the fluid, and dissipative Darcy flow representing the interaction between the two phases. The paper is concluded with a couple of numerical examples that display the predictive capabilities of the proposed formulation. In particular, we consider results for the kinematically linear theory as compared to the kinematically non-linear theory</title><text>A formulation for a porous medium saturated with a compressible fluid</text><keywords>nearly saturated porous media;compressible fluid;consistent thermodynamic formulation;two-phase mixture problem;robust numerical scheme;fluid compressibility;volumetric logarithmic strain;fluid pressure;entropy inequality;effective stress response;solid skeleton;fluid pressure response;dissipative Darcy flow;predictive capabilities;kinematically linear theory</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>Eliminating counterevidence with applications to accountable certificate management management by making it intractable for the certification authority (CA) to create contradictory statements about the validity of a certificate. The core of the method is a new primitive, undeniable attester, that allows someone to commit to some set S of bitstrings by publishing a short digest of S and to give attestations for any x that it is or is not a member of S. Such an attestation can be verified by obtaining in an authenticated way the published digest and applying a verification algorithm to the triple of the bitstring, the attestation and the digest. The most important feature of this primitive is the intractability of creating two contradictory proofs for the same candidate element x and digest. We give an efficient construction for undeniable attesters based on authenticated search trees. We show that the construction also applies to sets of more structured elements. We also show that undeniable attesters exist iff collision-resistant hash functions exist</title><text>This paper presents a method to increase the accountability of certificate</text><keywords>accountable certificate management;accountability;certification authority;attestations;published digest;verification algorithm;bitstring;contradictory proofs;authenticated search trees;structured elements;collision-resistant hash functions</keywords></doc>

Based on the concept of VR decomposition, the problem of management of such systems is discussed. As a sub-type that makes mMAS closer to the application sphere, an evolutionary multi-agent system (EMAS) is proposed. EMAS combines features of mMAS with advantages of an evolutionary model of computation. As an illustration of this consideration two particular EMAS are presented, which allow us to obtain promising results in the fields of multiobjective optimisation and time-series prediction, and thus justify the approach</title><text>Dual nature of mass multi-agent systems (mMAS) emerging as an internal discord</text><keywords>VR decomposition;multiobjective optimisation;time-series prediction</keywords></doc>

The two facility problem (TFOC) is similar, but capacity can be purchased either in batches of C units or one unit. Flow costs are zero. These problems are known to be NP-hard. We describe an exact O(n/sup 3/3/sup n/) algorithm for these problems based on the repeated use of a bipartite matching algorithm. We also present a better lower bound of Omega (n/sup 2k*/) for an earlier Omega (n/sup 2k/) algorithm described in the literature where k = [d/C] and k* = min{k, [(n 2)/2]}. The matching algorithm is faster than this one for k >or= [(n - 2)/2]. Finally, we provide another reformulation of the problem that is quasi integral. This property could be useful in designing a modified version of the simplex method to solve the problem using a sequence of pivots with integer extreme solutions, referred to as the integral simplex method in the literature</title><text>The one facility one commodity network design problem (OFOC) with nonnegative</text><keywords>one facility one commodity network design problem;two facility network design;flow costs;bipartite matching algorithm;lower bound;quasi integral;pivots;integral simplex method</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>Turning telecommunications call details to churn prediction: a data mining approach telecommunications industry, churn prediction and management has become of great concern to mobile service providers. A mobile service provider wishing to retain its subscribers needs to be able to predict which of them may be at-risk of changing services and will make those subscribers the focus of customer retention efforts. In response to the limitations of existing churn-prediction systems and the unavailability of customer demographics in the mobile telecommunications provider investigated, we propose, design, and experimentally evaluate a churn-prediction technique that predicts churning from subscriber contractual information and call pattern changes extracted from call details. This proposed technique is capable of identifying potential churners at the contract level for a specific prediction time-period. In addition, the proposed technique incorporates the multi-classifier class-combiner approach to address the challenge of a highly skewed class distribution between churners and non-churners. The empirical evaluation results suggest that the proposed call-behavior-based churn-prediction technique exhibits satisfactory predictive effectiveness when more recent call details are employed for the churn prediction model construction. Furthermore, the proposed technique is able to demonstrate satisfactory or reasonable predictive power within the one-month interval between model construction and churn prediction. Using a previous demographics-based churn-prediction system as a reference, the lift factors attained by our proposed technique appear largely satisfactory</title><text>As deregulation, new technologies, and new competitors open up the mobile</text><keywords>telecommunications call details;mobile service providers;deregulation;customer retention efforts;customer demographics;subscriber contractual information;call pattern changes;multi-classifier class-combiner approach;skewed class distribution;lift factors</keywords></doc>

Sophisticated databases, data mining, neural networks and statistical capabilities have enabled the development of predictive segmentation techniques.

Both geometric nonlinearity and three components of wind loads are considered in this method. The example bridge is the second Santou Bay cable-stayed bridge with a main span length of 518 m built in China. Aerostatic stability of the example bridge is investigated using linear and proposed methods. The effect of pitch moment coefficient on the aerostatic stability of the bridge has been studied. The results show that the aerostatic instability analyses of cable-stayed bridges based on the linear method considerably overestimate the wind-resisting capacity of cable-stayed bridges. The proposed method is highly accurate and efficient. Pitch moment coefficient has a major effect on the aerostatic stability of cable-stayed bridges.

MRP systems are commonly used for scheduling, although their inability to deal with capacity constraints adequately is a severe drawback. In this study, we show that material requirements planning can be done more effectively in a job shop environment using a resource constrained project scheduling model. The proposed model augments MRP models by incorporating capacity constraints and using variable lead time lengths. The efficacy of this approach is tested on MRP systems by comparing the inventory carrying costs and resource allocation of the solutions obtained by the proposed model to those obtained by using a traditional MRP model. In general, it is concluded that the proposed model provides improved schedules with considerable reductions in inventory carrying costs</title><text>One of the most difficult tasks in a job shop manufacturing environment is to</text><keywords>job shop environment;MRP;resource constrained project scheduling model;material requirements planning;scheduling;capacity constraints;variable lead time lengths;inventory carrying costs;resource allocation</keywords></doc>

Although some vehicles can decide to either generate warnings for the human driver or control the vehicle autonomously, they must usually make these decisions in real time with only incomplete information. So, human drivers must still maintain control over the vehicle. I sketch a digital driving behavior model. By simulating and analyzing driver behavior during different maneuvers such as lane changing, lane following, and traffic avoidance, researchers participating in the Beijing Institute of Technology's digital-driving project will be able to examine the possible correlations or causal relations between the smart vehicle, IVISs, the intelligent road-traffic-information network, and the driver.

If faster execution of an activity is desired then additional resources at extra cost would be required. Given a project network, the cost structure for each activity and a planning horizon, the project compression problem is concerned with the determination of optimal schedule of performing each activity while satisfying given restrictions and minimizing the total cost of project execution. The paper considers the project compression problem with time dependent cost structure for each activity. The planning horizon is divided into several regular time intervals over which the cost structure of an activity may vary. But the cost structure of the activities remains the same within a time interval. The objective is to find an optimal project schedule minimizing the total project cost. We present a mathematical model for this problem, develop some heuristics and an exact branch and bound algorithm. Using simulated problems we provide an insight into the computational performances of heuristics and the branch and bound algorithm</title><text>In a given project network, execution of each activity in normal duration</text><keywords>project scheduling;time dependent costs;branch and bound algorithm;project network;planning horizon;project compression problem;optimal schedule;heuristics</keywords></doc>

We consider the problem of approximating optimal strategies for the batch service of customers at a service station. Customers stochastically arrive at the station and wait to be served, incurring a waiting cost and a service cost. Service of customers is performed in groups of a fixed service capacity. We investigate the structure of cost functions and establish some theoretical results including monotonicity of the value functions. Then, we use our adaptive dynamic programming monotone algorithm that uses structure to preserve monotonicity of the estimates at each iterations to approximate the value functions. Since the problem with homogeneous customers can be solved optimally, we have a means of comparison to evaluate our heuristic. Finally, we compare our algorithm to classical forward dynamic programming methods</title><text>The purpose of this paper is to illustrate the importance of using structural</text><keywords>stochastic batch service problem;adaptive dynamic programming algorithms;service station;waiting cost;service cost;fixed service capacity</keywords></doc>

It encourages the development of a capability to cope with some key drivers of major change. These have been identified as globalisation, the advent of fully automated cadastral environments, improved decentralised methods of governance and greatly improved service delivery of future cadastral systems to a wide range of users. The paper promotes the registration of title supported by government guarantee as an effective means for rapidly introducing cadastral systems to facilitate globally competitive land markets in developing countries. In developing automated environments for cadastral systems, the need to completely re-engineer and redesign cadastral systems to meet basic cadastral principles and responsiveness to individual user needs is promoted. In this environment, highly decentralised cadastral operations and administration combined with light regulatory control are advocated as a future governance strategy. With regard to the level of services to users, an emphasis on recognising and serving the future needs of users is seen as essential. International and national professional and user organisations involved in land administration are seen as an important vehicle for developing strategies and providing evaluation to guide the over-arching development of cadastral systems around the world</title><text>Although the paper recognises the merits of the evolution of cadastral systems</text><keywords>globalisation;automated cadastral environments;service delivery;government guarantee;globally competitive land markets;developing countries;automated environments;cadastral principles;user needs;highly decentralised cadastral operations;light regulatory control;future governance strategy;user organisations;land administration</keywords></doc>

Part 2: model calibration and feed rate scheduling paper presenting a new methodology for analytically simulating multi-axis machining of complex sculptured surfaces. The first section of this paper offers a detailed explanation of the model calibration procedure. A new methodology is presented for accurately determining the cutting force coefficients for multi-axis machining. The force model presented in Part 1 is reformulated so that the cutting force coefficients account for the effects of feed rate, cutting speed, and a complex cutting edge design. Experimental results are presented for the calibration procedure. Model verification tests were conducted with these cutting force coefficients. These tests demonstrate that the predicted forces are within 5% of experimentally measured forces. Simulated results are also shown for predicting dynamic cutting forces and static/dynamic tool deflection. The second section of the paper discusses how the modeling methodology can be applied for feed rate scheduling in an industrial application. A case study for process optimization of machining an airfoil-like surface is used for demonstration. Based on the predicted instantaneous chip load and/or a specified force constraint, the feed rate scheduling is utilized to increase the metal removal rate.

<doc><title>Ethnography, customers, and negotiated interactions at the airport massive delays resulting from inclement weather, overbooked flights, and airline operational difficulties. As schedules slipped, the delayed departures and late arrivals led to systemwide breakdowns, customers missed their connections, and airline work activities fell further out of sync. In offering possible answers, we emphasize the need to consider the customer as participant, following the human-centered computing model. Our study applied ethnographic methods to understand the airline system domain and the nature of airline delays, and it revealed the deficiencies of the airline production system model of operations. The research insights that led us to shift from a production and marketing system perspective to a customer-as-participant view might appear obvious to some readers.

<doc><title>A column generation approach to delivery planning over time with inhomogeneous service providers and service interval constraints Deliveries must be made to customers having nominated demand in each time period. Demand must be met in each time period by use of some combination of inhomogeneous service providers. Each service provider has a different delivery capacity, different cost of delivery to each customer, a different utilisation requirement, and different rules governing the spread of deliveries in time. The problem is to plan deliveries so as to minimise overall costs, subject to demand being met and service rules obeyed. A natural integer programming model was found to be intractable, except on problems with loose demand constraints, with gaps between best lower bound and best feasible solution of up to 35.1%, with an average of 15.4% over the test data set. In all but the problem with loosest demand constraints, Cplex 6.5 applied to this formulation failed to find the optimal solution before running out of memory. However a column generation approach improved the lower bound by between 0.6% and 21.9%, with an average of 9.9%, and in all cases found the optimal solution at the root node, without requiring branching</title><text>We consider a problem of delivery planning over multiple time periods.</text><keywords>column generation approach;delivery planning over time;inhomogeneous service providers;service interval constraints;delivery capacity;lower bound</keywords></doc>

This task is not only about sufficiently exact representation of the effective forces but also about user-friendly and practical relevant applicability, especially when the experimental tyre-input-data is incomplete or missing. This text firstly describes the basics of the vehicle dynamic tyre model, conceived to be a physically based, semi-empirical model for application in connection with multi-body-systems (MBS). On the basis of tyres for a passenger car and a heavy truck the simulated steady state tyre characteristics are shown together and compared with the underlying experimental values. The possibility to link the tyre model TMeasy to any MBS-program is described, as far as it supports the 'Standard Tyre Interface'.

In the teleconsultations, the doctor was located in a hospital 6 km away from the MATS and used a videoconferencing link connected at 384 kbit/s. There were 30 patients in the conventional group and 30 in the telemedical group. The presenting problems were similar in the two groups. The mean duration of teleconsultations was 951 s and the mean duration of face-to-face consultations was 247 s. In doctor-nurse communication there was a higher rate of turn taking in teleconsultations than in face-to-face consultations; there were also more interruptions, more words and more `backchannels' (e.g. `mhm', `uh-huh') per teleconsultation. In doctor-patient communication there was a higher rate of turn taking, more words, more interruptions and more backchannels per teleconsultation. In patient-nurse communication there was. relatively little difference between the two modes of consulting the doctor. Telemedicine appeared to empower the patient to ask more questions of the doctor.

<doc><title>Sliding mode dynamics in continuous feedback control for distributed discrete-event scheduling events is presented motivated by the need for control theoretic techniques to analyze and design such systems in distributed manufacturing applications. These continuous feedback control systems exhibit highly nonlinear and discontinuous dynamics. Specifically, when the production demand in the manufacturing system exceeds the available resource capacity then the control system "chatters" and exhibits sliding modes. This sliding mode behavior is advantageously used in the scheduling application by allowing the system to visit different schedules within an infinitesimal region near the sliding surface. In the paper, an analytical model is developed to characterize the sliding mode dynamics. This model is then used to design controllers in the sliding mode domain to improve the effectiveness of the control system to "search" for schedules with good performance. Computational results indicate that the continuous feedback control approach can provide near-optimal schedules and that it is computationally efficient compared to existing scheduling techniques</title><text>A continuous feedback control approach for real-time scheduling of discrete</text><keywords>sliding mode dynamics;continuous feedback control;distributed discrete-event scheduling;real-time scheduling;control theoretic techniques;distributed manufacturing applications;production demand;resource capacity</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>Technology in distance education: a global perspective to alternative delivery mechanisms distance education at the university level. Some institutions are incorporating distance education as a way to extend the classroom. Other institutions are investigating new delivery mechanisms, which support a revised perspective on education. These latter institutions are revising their processes for interacting with students, and taking a more "learner centered" approach to the delivery of education. This article discusses the impact of technology on the delivery mechanisms employed in distance education. A framework is proposed here, which presents a description of alternative modes of generic delivery mechanisms. It is suggested that those institutions, which adopt a delivery mechanism employing an asynchronous mode, can gain the most benefit from technology. This approach seems to represent the only truly innovative use of technology in distance education. The approach creates a student-oriented environment while maintaining high levels of interaction, both of which are factors that contribute to student satisfaction with their overall educational experience</title><text>Technology is providing a positive impact on delivery mechanisms employed in</text><keywords>distance education;learner centered approach;student satisfaction;global perspective;asynchronous mode</keywords></doc>

The Semantic Web offers a solution, capturing and exploiting the meaning of terms to transform the Web from a platform that focuses on presenting information, to a platform that focuses on understanding and reasoning with information. To support Semantic Web development, the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency launched the DARPA Agent Markup Language (DAML) initiative to fund research in languages, tools, infrastructure, and applications that make Web content more accessible and understandable. Although the US government funds DAML, several organizations-including US and European businesses and universities, and international consortia such as the World Wide Web Consortium-have contributed to work on issues related to DAML's development and deployment. We focus on DAML's current markup language, DAML+OIL, which is a proposed starting point for the W3C's Semantic Web Activity's Ontology Web Language (OWL).

Doing so ensures that-downstream process sequences operate on work-in-progress that is well within control. Because point-of-use visibility of work-in-progress quality has become of paramount concern in the industry's drive to reduce scrap and improve yield, controlling trench depth has assumed greater importance. An integrated, interferometric based, rate monitor for etch-to-depth and spacer etch applications has been developed for controlling this parameter. This article demonstrates that the integrated rate monitor, using polarization and digital signal processing, enhances control etch-to-depth processes and can also be implemented as a predictive endpoint in a wafer manufacturing environment for dual damascene trench etch and spacer etch applications</title><text>The migration to tighter geometries and more complex process sequence</text><keywords>integrated process control;polarization;digital signal processing;wafer manufacturing environment;dual damascene trench etch;spacer etch applications;target specifications;point-of-use visibility;work-in-progress quality</keywords></doc>

To shorten connections between inputs and outputs and/or make related modules adjacent, it is desired to place some modules along the specific boundaries of a chip. To deal with such boundary constraints, we explore the feasibility conditions of a B*-tree with boundary constraints and develop a simulated annealing-based algorithm using B*-trees. Unlike most previous work, the proposed algorithm guarantees a feasible B*-tree with boundary constraints for each perturbation.

Since this form is inconvenient for characterising the time-domain properties of sampled-data loops and for computerising the design of such systems, a state-space formulation is developed. Under the new interpretation, the matched pole-zero model is shown to be structurally identical to a hold-equivalent discrete-time model, where the generalised hold takes integral part, thus unifying the most widely used discretisation approaches. An algorithm for obtaining the generalised hold function is presented. The hold-equivalent structure of the matched pole-zero model clarifies several discrete-time system properties, such as controllability and observability, and their preservation or loss with a matched pole-zero discretisation. With the proposed formulation, the matched pole-zero, hold-equivalent, and mapping models can now all be constructed with a single schematic model</title><text>Deals with matched pole-zero discretisation, which has been used in practice</text><keywords>structural interpretation;matched pole-zero discretisation;continuous-time systems;time-domain properties;sampled-data loops;state-space formulation;hold-equivalent discrete-time model;controllability;observability</keywords></doc>

This duty timetable is spread over a certain period, known as the roster planning horizon. Train crew management may arise either from the planning stage, when the total number of crew and crew distributions are to be determined, or from the operating stage when the number of crew at each depot is known as input data. In this paper, we are interested in train crew management in the planning stage. In the literature, train crew management is decomposed into two stages: crew scheduling and crew rostering which are solved sequentially. We propose an integrated optimization model to solve both crew scheduling and crew rostering. The model enables us to generate either cyclic rosters or non-cyclic rosters. Numerical experiments are carried out over data sets arising from a practical application</title><text>Train crew management involves the development of a duty timetable for each of</text><keywords>integrated optimization model;train crew management;duty timetable;rail transport organization;roster planning horizon;crew scheduling;crew rostering;cyclic rosters</keywords></doc>

Checking if a given XML document is valid is called the validation problem, and is typically performed by a parser (hence, validating parser), more precisely it is performed right after parsing, by the same program module. In practice however, XML documents are often generated dynamically, by some program: checking whether all XML documents generated by the program are valid WRT a given type is called the typechecking problem. While a validation analyzes an XML document, a type checker analyzes a program, and the problem's difficulty is a function of the language in which that program is expressed. The XML typechecking problem has been investigated recently and the XQuery Working Group adopted some of these techniques for typechecking XQuery. All these techniques, however, have limitations which need to be understood and further explored and investigated.

Each time-critical reasoning unit is designed in such a way that it delivers an approximate result in time whenever an overload or a failure prevents the system from producing the most accurate result. Indeed, reasoning units use approximate processing based on two salient features. First, an incremental processing unit constructs an approximate solution quickly and then refines it incrementally. Second, a multiple methods approach proposes different alternatives to solve the problem, each of them being selected according to the available resources. In allowing several resource-bounded reasoning paradigms to be combined, we hope to extend their actual scope to cover more real-world application domains</title><text>In this paper, PRIMES (Progressive Reasoning and Intelligent multiple MEthods</text><keywords>resource-bounded reasoning techniques;time-critical reasoning unit;approximate processing;PRIMES;progressive reasoning</keywords></doc>

Considering that X-ray cineangiocardiography is still commonly employed in clinical cardiology and computational costs for 3-D recovery and visualization are rapidly decreasing, it is meaningful to develop a clinically applicable system for 3-D LV shape recovery from X-ray cineangiocardiograms. The system is based on a previously reported closed-surface method of shape recovery from two-dimensional occluding contours with multiple views. To apply the method to "real" LV cineangiocardiograms, user-interactive systems were implemented for preprocessing, including detection of LV contours, calibration of the imaging geometry, and setting of the LV model coordinate system. The results for three real LV angiographic image sequences are presented, two with fixed multiple views (using supplementary angiography) and one with rotating views. 3-D reconstructions utilizing different numbers of views were compared and evaluated in terms of contours manually traced by an experienced radiologist. The performance of the preprocesses was also evaluated, and the effects of variations in user-specified parameters on the final 3-D reconstruction results were shown to be sufficiently small. These experimental results demonstrate the potential usefulness of combining multiple views for 3-D recovery from "real" LV cineangiocardiograms</title><text>This paper reports on the clinical application of a system for recovering the</text><keywords>multiview X-ray cineangiocardiograms;clinical cardiology;two-dimensional occluding contours;computational costs;user-interactive systems;angiographic image sequences;fixed multiple views;experienced radiologist</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>Breast cancer: effectiveness of computer-aided diagnosis-observer study with independent database of mammograms to radiologists reviewing clinical mammograms for which the diagnoses were unknown to both the radiologists and the computer. Six mammographers and six community radiologists participated in an observer study. These 12 radiologists interpreted, with and without the computer aid, 110 cases that were unknown to both the 12 radiologist observers and the trained computer classification scheme. The radiologists' performances in differentiating between benign and malignant masses without and with the computer aid were evaluated with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Two-tailed P values were calculated for the Student t test to indicate the statistical significance of the differences in performances with and without the computer aid. When the computer aid was used, the average performance of the 12 radiologists improved, as indicated by an increase in the area under the ROC curve (A/sub z/) from 0.93 to 0.96 (P<.001), by an increase in partial area under the ROC curve (/sub 0.9/0A'/sub z/) from 0.56 to 0.72 (P<.001), and by an increase in sensitivity from 94% to 98% (P=.022). No statistically significant difference in specificity was found between readings with and those without computer aid ( Delta +-0.014; P=.46; 95% Cl: -0.054, 0.026), where Delta is difference in specificity. When we analyzed results from the mammographers and community radiologists as separate groups, a larger improvement was demonstrated for the community radiologists.

<doc><title>A formal model of correctness in a cadastre Correctness is defined to be the proper correspondence between the valid legal situation and the content of the cadastre. This correspondence is generally difficult to achieve, since the cadastre is not a complete representation of all aspects influencing the legal situation in reality. The goal of the paper is to develop a formal model comprising representations of the cadastre and of reality that allows the simulation and investigation of cases where this correspondence is potentially violated. For this purpose the model consists of two parts, the first part represents the valid legal situation and the second part represents the cadastre. This makes it feasible to mark the differences between reality and the cadastre. The marking together with the two parts of the model facilitate the discussion of issues in "real-world" cadastral systems where incorrectness occurs. In order to develop a formal model, the paper uses the transfer of ownership of a parcel between two persons as minimal case study. The foundation for the formalization is a modern version of the situation calculus. The focus moves from the analysis of the cadastre to the preparation of a conceptual and a formalized model and the implementation of a prototype</title><text>A key issue for cadastral systems is the maintenance of their correctness.</text><keywords>cadastre;cadastral systems;legal situation;formal model;transfer of ownership;minimal case study;situation calculus;formalized model</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>Approximate relaxed descent method for optimal control problems differential equations with control constraints. Since no convexity assumptions are made on the data, the problem is reformulated in relaxed form. The relaxed state equation is discretized by the implicit trapezoidal scheme and the relaxed controls are approximated by piecewise constant relaxed controls. We then propose a combined descent and discretization method that generates sequences of discrete relaxed controls and progressively refines the discretization. Since here the adjoint of the discrete state equation is not defined, we use, at each iteration, an approximate derivative of the cost functional defined by discretizing the continuous adjoint equation and the integral involved by appropriate trapezoidal schemes. It is proved that accumulation points of sequences constructed by this method satisfy the strong relaxed necessary conditions for optimality for the continuous problem. Finally, the computed relaxed controls can be easily approximated by piecewise constant classical controls</title><text>We consider an optimal control problem for systems governed by ordinary</text><keywords>approximate relaxed descent method;optimal control problems;implicit trapezoidal scheme;piecewise constant relaxed controls;discrete state equation;trapezoidal schemes</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>Knowledge model reuse: therapy decision through specialisation of a generic decision model Heuristic Multi-Attribute (HM) solving method, in the form of a KADS-style specification. The goal of the therapy decision task is to identify the ideal therapy, for a given patient, in accordance with a set of objectives of a diverse nature constituting a global therapy-evaluation framework in which considerations such as patient preferences and quality-of-life results are integrated. We give a high-level overview of this task as a specialisation of the generic decision task, and additional decomposition methods for the subtasks involved. These subtasks possess some reflective capabilities for reasoning about self-models, particularly the learning subtask, which incrementally corrects and refines the model used to assess the effects of the therapies. This work illustrates the process of reuse in the framework of AI software development methodologies such as KADS-CommonKADS in order to obtain new (more specialised but still generic) components for the analysis libraries developed in this context. In order to maximise reuse benefits, where possible, the therapy decision task and HM method have been defined in terms of regular components from the earlier-mentioned libraries. To emphasise the importance of using a rigorous approach to the modelling of domain and method ontologies, we make extensive use of the semi-formal object-oriented analysis notation UML, together with its associated constraint language OCL, to illustrate the ontology of the decision method and the corresponding specific one of the therapy decision domain, the latter being a refinement via inheritance of the former</title><text>We present the definition of the therapy decision task and its associated</text><keywords>knowledge model reuse;therapy decision task;KADS-style specification;global therapy-evaluation framework;patient preferences;reasoning;learning subtask;software development methodologies;ontologies;object-oriented analysis notation;UML;constraint language;OCL</keywords></doc>
<doc><title>Agreeing with automated diagnostic aids: a study of users' concurrence strategies unwarranted levels of disuse by operators. In the present study, users' tendencies to either agree or disagree with automated diagnostic aids were examined under conditions in which: (1) the aids were less than perfectly reliable but aided-diagnosis was still more accurate that unaided diagnosis; and (2) the system was completely opaque, affording users no additional information upon which to base a diagnosis. The results revealed that some users adopted a strategy of always agreeing with the aids, thereby maximizing the number of correct diagnoses made over several trials. Other users, however, adopted a probability-matching strategy in which agreement and disagreement rates matched the rate of correct and incorrect diagnoses of the aids. The probability-matching strategy, therefore, resulted in diagnostic accuracy scores that were lower than was maximally possible. Users who adopted the maximization strategy had higher self-ratings of problem-solving and decision-making skills, were more accurate in estimating aid reliabilities, and were more confident in their diagnosis on trials in which they agreed with the aids. The potential applications of these findings include the design of interface and training solutions that facilitate the adoption of the most effective concurrence strategies by users of automated diagnostic aids</title><text>Automated diagnostic aids that are less than perfectly reliable often produce</text><keywords>automated diagnostic aids;probability-matching;disagreement rates;maximization;problem-solving;reliability</keywords></doc>

Every elliptic curve can be given by a Weierstrass equation E : y/sup 2/ + a/sub 1/xy + a/sub 3/y = x/sup 3/ + a/sub 2/x/sup 2/ + a/sub 4/x + a/sub 6/. Let Q be the set of rationals. E is said to be defined over Q if the coefficients a/sub i/, i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 are rationals and O is defined over Q. Let E/Q be an elliptic curve and let E(Q)/sub tors/ be the torsion group of points of E defined over Q. The theorem of Mazur asserts that E(Q)/sub tors/ is one of the following 15 groups E(Q)/sub tors/ {Z/mZ, Z/mZ * Z/2mZ, m, = 1, 2, ..., 10, 12, m = 1, 2, 3, 4. We say that an elliptic curve E'/Q is isogenous to the elliptic curve E if there is an isogeny, i.e. a morphism phi : E to E' such that phi (O) = O, where O is the point at infinity. We give an explicit model of all elliptic curves for which E(Q)/sub tors/ is in the form Z/mZ where m = 9,10,12 or Z/2Z * Z/2mZ where m = 4, according to Mazur's theorem.

The summaries that human analysts make of these open answers, however, tend to rely too much on intuition and so aren't satisfactorily reliable. Moreover, because the Web makes it so easy to take surveys and solicit comments, companies are finding themselves inundated with data from questionnaires and other sources. Handling it all manually would be not only cumbersome but also costly. Thus, devising a computer system that can automatically mine useful information from open answers has become an important issue. We have developed a survey analysis system that works on these principles.

<doc><title>Mobile commerce: transforming the vision into reality (M-commerce) and proposes an integrated architecture that supports business and consumer needs in an optimal way to successfully implement M-commerce business processes. The key line of thought is based on the heuristic observation that customers will not want to receive M-commerce offerings to their mobile telephones. As a result, a pull as opposed to a push approach becomes a necessary requirement to conduct M-commerce. In addition, M-commerce has to rely on local, regional, demographic and many other variables to be truly effective. Both observations necessitate an M-commerce architecture that allows the coherent integration of enterprise-level systems as well as the aggregation of product and service offerings from many different and partially competing parties into a collaborative M-commerce platform. The key software component within this integrated architecture is an event management engine to monitor, detect, store, process and measure information about outside events that are relevant to all participants in M-commerce</title><text>This editorial preface investigates current developments in mobile commerce</text><keywords>M-commerce;mobile commerce;integrated architecture;consumer needs;mobile telephones;event management engine</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>Gossip is synteny: Incomplete gossip and the syntenic distance between genomes fusions, fissions, and translocations required to transform one into the other, ignoring the order of genes within chromosomes. Computing this distance is NP-hard. In the present work, we give a tight connection between syntenic distance and the incomplete gossip problem, a novel generalization of the classical gossip problem. In this problem, there are n gossipers, each with a unique piece of initial information; they communicate by phone calls in which the two participants exchange all their information. The goal is to minimize the total number of phone calls necessary to inform each gossiper of his set of relevant gossip which he desires to learn. As an application of the connection between syntenic distance and incomplete gossip, we derive an O(2/sup O(n log n)/) algorithm to exactly compute the syntenic distance between two genomes with at most n chromosomes each. Our algorithm requires O(n/sup 2/+2/sup O(d log d)/) time when this distance is d, improving the O(n/sup 2/+2(O(d//sup 2/))) running time of the best previous exact algorithm</title><text>The syntenic distance between two genomes is given by the minimum number of</text><keywords>syntenic distance;genomes;NP-hard;incomplete gossip problem;running time;chromosomes</keywords></doc>
<doc><title>The impact of the product mix on the value of flexibility referring to the ability to produce a broad range of products or variants with presumed low changeover costs. The value of such a capability is important to establish for an industrial firm in order to ensure that the flexibility provided will be at the right level and used profitably rather than in excess of market requirements and consequently costly. We use option-pricing theory to analyse the impact of various product-mix issues on the value of flexibility. The real options model we use incorporates multiple products, capacity constraints as well as set-up costs. The issues treated here include the number of products, demand variability, correlation between products, and the relative demand distribution within the product mix. Thus, we are interested in the nature of the input data to analyse its effect on the value of flexibility. We also check the impact at different capacity levels. The results suggest that the value of flexibility (i) increases with an increasing number of products, (ii) decreases with increasing volatility of product demand, (iii) decreases the more positively correlated the demand is, and (iv) reduces for marginal capacity with increasing levels of capacity. Of these, the impact of positively correlated demand seems to be a major issue. However, the joint impact of the number of products and demand correlation showed some non-intuitive results</title><text>Product-mix flexibility is one of the major types of manufacturing flexibility,</text><keywords>product-mix flexibility;manufacturing flexibility;low changeover costs;industrial firm;option-pricing theory;real options model;multiple products;capacity constraints;set-up costs;demand variability;relative demand distribution;marginal capacity;positively correlated demand;demand correlation</keywords></doc>

Based on this conclusion, four computational formulas of the maximal and minimal (maxi-mini) magnitudes and phases of an edge plant at a fixed frequency are given. The formulas, besides sharing a simpler form of expression, concretely display how the extrema of the frequency response of the edge plant relate to the typical characteristics of the arc and line segment such as the centre, radius and tangent points of the arc, the distance from the origin to the line segment etc. The direct application of the results is to compute the Bode-, Nichols- and Nyquist-plot collections of the systems which are needed in robustness analysis and design</title><text>The computation of the frequency response of systems depending affinely on</text><keywords>frequency response;uncertain parameters;one-dimensional edge plants;arc;line segment;Nyquist-plot;robustness analysis</keywords></doc>

The signature analyser used comprises a general-structure two-input compacting module (TICM), which simplifies the motherboard VLSI design by providing a flexible geometry, which could be easily integrated with neighbouring structures. The use of the modified data probe eliminates the ambiguity introduced by the high-impedance state and at the same time retains the same signature of the binary stream. The model specifies algebraically the effects of the TICM architecture, the test pattern length, and the control stream error probabilities. It is proved that the (hardware) criterion used for calculating the AEP for the internal- and external exclusive-OR two-input shift registers is not valid for the general case and a new criterion is provided.

The ebXML framework provides such a specification schema called BPSS (Business Process Specification Schema) which is available in two standalone representations: a UML version, and an XML version. The former, however, is not intended for the direct creation of business process specifications, but for defining specification elements and their relationships required for creating an ebXML-compliant business process specification. For this reason, it is very important to support conceptual modeling that is well organized and directly matched with major modeling concepts. This paper deals with how to represent and manage B2B business processes using UML-compliant diagrams. The major challenge is to organize UML diagrams in a natural way that is well suited to the business process meta-model and then to transform the diagrams into an XML version.

We searched the MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and HealthSTAR databases and printed resources, and interviewed investigators in the field. We excluded studies where the service did not historically require face-to-face encounters (e.g. radiology or pathology diagnosis). A total of 58 articles met the inclusion criteria. The articles were summarized and graded for the quality and direction of the evidence. There were very few high-quality studies. The strongest evidence for the efficacy of telemedicine for diagnostic and management decisions came from the specialties of psychiatry and dermatology. There was also reasonable evidence that general medical history and physical examinations performed via telemedicine had relatively good sensitivity and specificity. Other specialties in which some evidence for efficacy existed were cardiology and certain areas of ophthalmology.

In this analysis, a new concise procedure for the analytical solution of composite laminated plates with piezoelectric layers is developed. A simple eigenvalue formula in real number form is directly developed from the basic coupled piezoelectric differential equations and the difficulty of treating imaginary eigenvalues is avoided. The solution is defined in the trigonometric series and can be applied to thin and thick plates. Numerical studies are conducted on a five-layer piezoelectric plate and the complexity of stresses and deformations under combined loading is illustrated.

Our earlier system, GUILD (Downing and Zvirinsky, Artificial Life, 5, p.291-318, 1999), displayed emergent regulation of the chemical environment by a population of metabolizing agents, but the chemical model underlying those results was trivial, essentially admitting all possible reactions at a single energy cost. The new model, METAMIC, utilizes abstract chemistries that are both (a) constrained to a small set of legal reactions, and (b) grounded in basic fundamental relationships between energy, entropy, and biomass synthesis/breakdown. To explore the general phenomena of emergent homeostasis, we generate 100 different chemistries and use each as the basis for several METAMIC runs, as part of a Gaia hunt. This search discovers 20 chemistries that support microbial populations capable of regulating a physical environmental factor within their growth-optimal range, despite the extra metabolic cost. Case studies from the Gaia hunt illustrate a few simple mechanisms by which real biota might exploit the underlying chemistry to achieve some control over their physical environment. Although these results shed little light on the question of Gaia on Earth, they support the possibility of emergent environmental control at the microcosmic level</title><text>This work continues investigation into Gaia theory (Lovelock, The ages of Gaia,</text><keywords>simulated emergence;evolving microcosms;natural selection;metabolizing agents;chemical model;emergent homeostasis;Gaia hunt;Gaia theory;artificial life;emergent distributed environmental control</keywords></doc>

The author assesses how local authorities, and other agencies concerned with property and address datasets, are coping with the introduction of British Standard 7666, and examines the prospects and limitations of this development. British Standard 7666 has four parts, comprising specifications for street gazetteer; land and property gazetteer; addresses; and public rights of way. The organisation coordinating the introduction of British Standard 7666, Improvement and Development Agency (IDeA), is also overseeing the development and maintenance of a National Land and Property Gazetteer (NLPG) based on British Standard 7666.

<doc><title>Human face detection in visual scenes using neural networks is to design a system that can detect human faces in visual scenes at high searching speed and accuracy. We used a neural network with a simple structure but trained using face and non-face samples preprocessed by several methods (position normalization, histogram equalization, etc.) to attain high accuracy, then pruned the size of the neural network so that it could run faster and reduced the total search area of a target visual scene using the skin color detector. Skin color detection assumes that faces reside only in skin color regions. The system design is made up of two parts: the face detecting system that detects the faces, and the searching speed improving system. Speed improvement is achieved by reducing the face locator network size using the structural learning with knowledge and by reducing the face search area using the skin color detection system. Faster training of the neural networks was also achieved using variable step sizes</title><text>This paper presents a neural network based face detection system.

<doc><title>An ACL for a dynamic system of agents The ACL includes a set of conversation performatives extended with operations to register, create, and terminate agents. The main design goal at the agent-level is to provide only knowledge-level primitives that are well integrated with the dynamic nature of the system. This goal has been achieved by defining an anonymous interaction protocol which enables agents to request and supply knowledge without considering symbol-level issues concerning management of agent names, routing, and agent reachability. This anonymous interaction protocol exploits a distributed facilitator schema which is hidden at the agent-level and provides mechanisms for registering capabilities of agents and delivering requests according to the competence of agents. We present a formal specification of the ACL and of the underlying architecture, exploiting an algebra of actors, and illustrate it with the help of a graphical notation. This approach provides the basis for discussing dynamic primitives in ACL and for studying properties of dynamic multi agent systems, for example concerning the behavior of agents and the correctness of their conversation policies</title><text>In this article we present the design of an ACL for a dynamic system of agents.</text><keywords>ACL;dynamic system of agents;system of agents;agents;dynamic system;distributed facilitator;actors;anonymous interaction protocol</keywords></doc>
<doc><title>Supporting global user profiles through trusted authorities unique and individual needs of each user. We argue that for personalization to work effectively, detailed and interoperable user profiles should be globally available for authorized sites, and these profiles should dynamically reflect changes in user interests. Creating user profiles from user click-stream data seems to be an effective way of generating detailed and dynamic user profiles. However, a user profile generated in this way is available only on the computer where the user accesses his browser, and is inaccessible when the same user works on a different computer. On the other hand, integration of the Internet with telecommunication networks has made it possible for the users to connect to the Web with a variety of mobile devices as well as desktops. This requires that user profiles should be available to any desktop or mobile device on the Internet that users choose to work with. In this paper, we address these problems through the concept of "trusted authority". A user agent at the client side that captures the user click stream, dynamically generates a navigational history 'log' file in Extensible Markup Language (XML). This log file is then used to produce 'user profiles' in a resource description framework (RDF). A user's right to privacy is provided through the Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P) standard. User profiles are uploaded to the trusted authority and served next time the user connects to the Web</title><text>Personalization generally refers to making a Web site more responsive to the</text><keywords>global user profiles;trusted authorities;personalization;Web site;Internet;telecommunication networks;mobile device;user agent;user click stream;XML;resource description framework;privacy</keywords></doc>

This approach is then generalized to a broader class of nonlinear systems with delays that are called generalized Roesser systems. Finally, the theory is applied to analyze nonlinear time-delay systems. A weak observability is defined and characterized, generalizing the well-known linear result.

<doc><title>Quantitative analysis of reconstructed 3-D coronary arterial tree and intracoronary devices (2-D) projection views. These views are chosen by the angiographer to minimize vessel overlap and foreshortening. With 2-D projection views that are acquired in this nonstandardized fashion, however, there is no way to know or estimate how much error occurs in the QCA process. Furthermore, coronary arteries possess a curvilinear shape and undergo a cyclical deformation due to their attachment to the myocardium. Therefore, it is necessary to obtain three-dimensional (3-D) information to best describe and quantify the dynamic curvilinear nature of the human coronary artery. Using a patient-specific 3-D coronary reconstruction algorithm and routine angiographic images, a new technique is proposed to describe: (1) the curvilinear nature of 3-D coronary arteries and intracoronary devices; (2) the magnitude of the arterial deformation caused by intracoronary devices and due to heart motion; and (3) optimal view(s) with respect to the desired "pathway" for delivering intracoronary devices</title><text>Traditional quantitative coronary angiography is performed on two-dimensional</text><keywords>cyclical deformation;myocardium;patient-specific 3-D coronary reconstruction algorithm;routine angiographic images;human coronary artery</keywords></doc>

No differences in reading speed were found for any of the typeface combinations. In general, the 14-point size and the examined sans serif typefaces were perceived as being the easiest to read, fastest, most attractive, and most desirable for school-related material.

This approach furnishes a remarkably simple derivation for the polynomials u(t), upsilon (t), p(t), q(t) that specify the canonical form of a rotated Pythagorean hodograph, in terms of the original polynomials u(t), upsilon (t), p(t), q(t) and the angle theta and axis n of the spatial rotation.

The asymptotic behaviour of the fuzzy Markov system and its asymptotic variability is considered and given in closed analytic form. Moreover, the asymptotically attainable structures of the system are estimated also in a closed analytic form under some realistic assumptions. The importance of this result lies in the fact that in most cases the traditional methods for estimating the probabilities can not be used due to lack of data and measurement errors.

<doc><title>Estimation of 3-D left ventricular deformation from medical images using biomechanical models three-dimensional (3-D) image sequences has important clinical implications for the assessment of viability in the heart wall. We present here a generic methodology for estimating soft tissue deformation which integrates image-derived information with biomechanical models, and apply it to the problem of cardiac deformation estimation. The method is image modality independent. The images are segmented interactively and then initial correspondence is established using a shape-tracking approach. A dense motion field is then estimated using a transversely isotropic, linear-elastic model, which accounts for the muscle fiber directions in the left ventricle. The dense motion field is in turn used to calculate the deformation of the heart wall in terms of strain in cardiac specific directions. The strains obtained using this approach in open-chest dogs before and after coronary occlusion, exhibit a high correlation with strains produced in the same animals using implanted markers. Further, they show good agreement with previously published results in the literature. This proposed method provides quantitative regional 3-D estimates of heart deformation</title><text>The quantitative estimation of regional cardiac deformation from</text><keywords>biomechanical models;regional cardiac deformation;quantitative estimation;cardiac specific directions;open-chest dogs;muscle fiber directions;generic methodology;3-D image sequences</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>Process specialization: defining specialization for state diagrams in organizational process modeling as it is in object modeling. It would help us better understand, maintain, reuse, and generate process models. However, even though object-oriented analysis and design methodologies take full advantage of the object specialization hierarchy, the process specialization hierarchy is not supported in major process representations, such as the state diagram, data flow diagram, and UML representations. Partly underlying this lack of support is an implicit assumption that we can always specialize a process by treating it as "just another object." We argue in this paper that this is not so straightforward as it might seem; we argue that a process-specific approach must be developed. We propose such an approach in the form of a set of transformations which, when applied to a process description, always result in specialization. We illustrate this approach by applying it to the state diagram representation and demonstrate that this approach to process specialization is not only theoretically possible, but shows promise as a method for categorizing and analyzing processes. We point out apparent inconsistencies between our notion of process specialization and existing work on object specialization but show that these inconsistencies are superficial and that the definition we provide is compatible with the traditional notion of specialization</title><text>A precise definition of specialization and inheritance promises to be as useful</text><keywords>process specialization;state diagrams;inheritance;organizational process modeling;object-oriented analysis;object specialization hierarchy;process representation</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>A novel preterm respiratory mechanics active simulator to test the performances of neonatal pulmonary ventilators of the parameters of pulmonary mechanics of healthy newborns and preterm pathological infants. The implemented prototype is able to: (a) let the operator choose the respiratory pattern, times of apnea, episodes of cough, sobs, etc., (b) continuously regulate and control the parameters characterizing the pulmonary system; and, finally, (c) reproduce the attempt of breathing of a preterm infant. Taking into account both the limitation due to the chosen application field and the preliminary autocalibration phase automatically carried out by the proposed device, accuracy and reliability on the order of 1% is estimated. The previously indicated value has to be considered satisfactory in light of the field of application and the small values of the simulated parameters. Finally, the achieved metrological characteristics allow the described neonatal simulator to be adopted as a reference device to test performances of neonatal ventilators and, more specifically, to measure the time elapsed between the occurrence of a potentially dangerous condition to the patient and the activation of the corresponding alarm of the tested ventilator</title><text>A patient active simulator is proposed which is capable of reproducing values</text><keywords>preterm respiratory mechanics active simulator;neonatal pulmonary ventilators;patient active simulator;healthy newborns;preterm pathological infants;autocalibration phase;accuracy;reliability</keywords></doc>
<doc><title>A review of methodologies used in research on cadastral development consequence of experiences made during recent decades, several authors have stated the need for research in the domain of cadastre and proposed methodologies to be used. The paper contributes to the acceptance of research methodologies needed for cadastral development, and thereby enhances theory in the cadastral domain. The paper reviews nine publications on cadastre and identifies the methodologies used. The review focuses on the institutional, social, political and economic aspects of cadastral development, rather than on the technical aspects. The main conclusion is that the methodologies used are largely those of the social sciences. That agrees with the notion that cadastre relates as much to people and institutions, as it relates to land, and that cadastral systems are shaped by social, political and economic conditions, as well as technology. Since the geodetic survey profession has been the keeper of the cadastre, geodetic surveyors will have to deal ever more with social science matters, a fact that universities will have to consider</title><text>World-wide, much attention has been given to cadastral development.

QSS are continuous time systems where the input trajectories are piecewise constant functions and the state variable trajectories - being themselves piecewise linear functions - are converted into piecewise constant functions via a quantization function equipped with hysteresis. It is shown that QSS can be exactly represented and simulated by a discrete event model, within the framework of the DEVS-approach. Further, it is shown that QSS can be used to approximate continuous systems, thus allowing their discrete-event simulation in opposition to the classical discrete-time simulation. It is also shown that in an approximating QSS, some stability properties of the original system are conserved and the solutions of the QSS go to the solutions of the original system when the quantization goes to zero</title><text>A new class of dynamical systems, Quantized State Systems or QSS, is introduced</text><keywords>dynamical systems;Quantized State Systems;continuous time systems;piecewise constant functions;discrete event model;discrete-event simulation</keywords></doc>

The advantage of fuzzy control is that it is based on a linguistic description and does not require a mathematical model of the system. The fuzzy control scheme is realised on an inexpensive dedicated micro-controller (INTEL 8031) based system. The compensation process is based on sensing line currents only, an approach different from conventional methods, which require harmonics or reactive volt-ampere requirement of the load. The performance of the fuzzy logic controller is compared with a conventional PI controller. The dynamic behavior of the fuzzy controller is found to be better than the conventional PI controller.

<doc><title>Toward a formalism for conversation protocols using joint intention theory certain states in the world. Therefore, one may identify the landmarks or the states that must be brought about during the goal-directed execution of a protocol. Accordingly, the landmarks, characterized by propositions that are true in the state represented by that landmark, are the most important aspect of a protocol. Families of conversation protocols can be expressed formally as partially ordered landmarks after the landmarks necessary to achieve a goal have been identified. Concrete protocols represented as joint action expressions can, then, be derived from the partially ordered landmarks and executed directly by joint intention interpreters. This approach of applying Joint Intention theory to protocols also supports flexibility in the actions used to get to landmarks, shortcutting protocol execution, automatic exception handling, and correctness criterion for protocols and protocol compositions</title><text>Conversation protocols are used to achieve certain goals or to bring about</text><keywords>conversation protocols;protocol execution;automatic exception handling;correctness criterion</keywords></doc>

In the linear analysis, the linearized equations have bounded error increase under some compatible conditions. This contributes to the cancellation of instable Kelvin-Helmholtz terms. Under the effect of bottom, the existence of equations is hard to determine, but given some limitations it proves true. These limitations are that the swing of interfaces should be small enough, and the distance between surface and bottom should be large enough. In order to maintain the stability of computation, some compatible relationship must be satisfied. In the numerical examples, the simulation of standing waves and breaking waves are calculated. And in the case of shallow bottom, we found that the behavior of waves are rather singular</title><text>The motion of surface waves under the effect of bottom is a very interesting</text><keywords>numerical studies;2D free surface waves;boundary integral method;linear analysis;linearized equations;instable Kelvin-Helmholtz terms</keywords></doc>

For this purpose, a multilayer stack constructed of rubber and metal blocks is suitable, because it provides isolation in all degrees of freedom at once. In TAMA300, a 300 m interferometer in Japan, long-term dimensional stability and compatibility with an ultrahigh vacuum environment of about 10/sup -6/ Pa are also required. To keep the interferometer at its operating point despite ground strain and thermal drift of the isolation system, a thermal actuator was introduced. To prevent the high outgassing rate of the rubber from spoiling the vacuum, the rubber blocks were enclosed by gas-tight bellows. Using these techniques, we have successfully developed a three-layer stack which has a vibration isolation ratio of more than 10/sup 3/ at 300 Hz with control of drift and enough vacuum compatibility</title><text>Interferometric gravitational wave detectors require a large degree of</text><keywords>vibration isolation stack;interferometric gravitational wave detectors;rubber blocks;multilayer stack;metal blocks;long-term dimensional stability;ultrahigh vacuum environment;operating point;ground strain;thermal drift;thermal actuator;gas-tight bellows;vacuum compatibility</keywords></doc>

The objective is to find a schedule and job release dates that minimize the total resource consumption, and earliness and tardiness penalties.

Issues examined include professional education and training, initial career-planning and placement, continuing education, scouting and mentoring, job market conditions, work experience and personal skills, professional involvement, and professional association self-interest. This examination leads to five observations: 1. It is easier, in terms of career transitions, for a librarian to become an archivist than it is for an archivist to become a librarian; 2. The progression from a small college venue to a large research university is very manageable with the proper planning and experience; 3. At least three of the career elements-professional education, career-planning, and professional association self-interest-in their best moments provide a foundation that enables a future consideration of change between institutional types and professional areas and in their worst moments conspire against the midcareer professional in terms of change; 4.

Three types of activation functions are adopted in the network, namely, the traditional sigmoid function, the sinusoidal function and a periodic function that can be considered as a combination of the first two functions. To speed up the learning, as well as to reduce the network size, the extended Kalman filter (EKF) algorithm conjunct with a pruning method is used to train the network. The corresponding networks are applied to solve five typical problems, namely, 4-point XOR logic function, parity generation, handwritten digit recognition, piecewise linear function approximation and sunspot series prediction. Simulation results show that periodic activation functions perform better than monotonic ones in solving multicluster classification problems. Moreover, the combined periodic activation function is found to possess the fast convergence and multicluster classification capabilities of the sinusoidal activation function while keeping the robustness property of the sigmoid function required in the modelling of unknown systems</title><text>The authors investigate the convergence and pruning performance of multilayer</text><keywords>multilayer feedforward neural networks;extended Kalman filter algorithm;monotonic activation functions;periodic activation functions;convergence;pruning performance;neuronal activation functions;sigmoid function;sinusoidal function;EKF algorithm;4-point XOR logic function;parity generation;handwritten digit recognition;piecewise linear function approximation;sunspot series prediction;multicluster classification problems</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>Ecological interface design: progress and challenges human-computer interfaces for complex socio-technical systems. Its primary aim is to support knowledge workers in adapting to change and novelty. This literature review shows that in situations requiring problem solving, EID improves performance when compared with current design approaches in industry. EID has been applied to industry-scale problems in a broad variety of application domains (e.g., process control, aviation, computer network management, software engineering, medicine, command and control, and information retrieval) and has consistently led to the identification of new information requirements. An experimental evaluation of EID using a full-fidelity simulator with professional workers has yet to be conducted, although some are planned. Several significant challenges remain as obstacles to the confident use of EID in industry. Promising paths for addressing these outstanding issues are identified. Actual or potential applications of this research include improving the safety and productivity of complex socio-technical systems</title><text>Ecological interface design (EID) is a theoretical framework for designing</text><keywords>ecological interface design;human-computer interfaces;industry;productivity</keywords></doc>

There are n non-preemptive and simultaneously available jobs. Each job will incur an early (tardy) penalty if it is early (tardy) with respect to the common due window under a given schedule. The window size is a given parameter but the window location is a decision variable. The objective of the problem is to find a schedule that minimizes the weighted number of early and tardy jobs and the location penalty. We show that the problem is NP-complete in the ordinary sense and develop a dynamic programming based pseudo-polynomial algorithm. We conduct computational experiments, the results of which show that the performance of the dynamic algorithm is very good in terms of memory requirement and CPU time.

<doc><title>The best circulant preconditioners for Hermitian Toeplitz systems.II. The multiple-zero case preconditioners have been proposed previously for ill-conditioned Hermitian Toeplitz systems that are generated by nonnegative continuous functions with a zero of even order. The proposed circulant preconditioners can be constructed without requiring explicit knowledge of the generating functions. It was shown that the spectra of the preconditioned matrices are uniformly bounded except for a fixed number of outliers and that all eigenvalues are uniformly bounded away from zero. Therefore the conjugate gradient method converges linearly when applied to solving the circulant preconditioned systems. Previously it was claimed that this result can be extended to the case where the generating functions have multiple zeros. The main aim of this paper is to give a complete convergence proof of the method for this class of generating functions</title><text>For pt.I. see SIAM J. Numer. Anal., vol. 38, p. 876-896.

As usual in this kind of works, it is assumed that single fault occurs at a time and the fault treated is of random bias type. The FDI module is constructed using banks of robust two-stage Kalman filters, which simultaneously estimate the state and the fault bias, and generate residual sets decoupled from unknown disturbances. All elements of residual sets are evaluated by using a hypothesis statistical test, and the fault is declared according to the prepared decision logic. The FTC module is activated based on the fault indicator, and additive compensation signal is computed using the fault bias estimate and combined to the nominal control law for compensating the fault's effect on the system. Simulation results for the simplified longitudinal flight control system with parameter variations, process and measurement noises demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach proposed</title><text>This paper presents an integrated robust fault detection and isolation (FDI)</text><keywords>fault detection;fault tolerant control;stochastic systems;two-stage Kalman filters;longitudinal flight control system</keywords></doc>

Connectivity among points is obtained with the use of the alpha shapes theory. This novel data representation has a number of interesting characteristics, such as (1) it allows us to automatically segment and quantify a number of important structural features from low-resolution maps, such as cavities and channels, opening the possibility of querying large collections of maps on the basis of these quantitative structural features; (2) it provides a compact representation in terms of size; (3) it contains a subset of three-dimensional points that optimally quantify the densities of medium resolution data; and (4) a general model of the geometry and topology of the macromolecule (as opposite to a spatially unrelated bunch of voxels) is easily obtained by the use of the alpha shapes theory</title><text>We develop an efficient way of representing the geometry and topology of</text><keywords>geometry;topology;volumetric datasets;biological structures;database framework;vector quantization algorithm;low-resolution density maps;biological macromolecules;modeling;probability density function;data representation;structural features;cavities;channels;connectivity;compact representation;three-dimensional points;medium resolution data;general model;original volume data;alpha shapes theory</keywords></doc>

However little is known about the determinants of the individual's knowledge sharing behavior. The purpose of this study is to develop an understanding of the factors affecting the individual's knowledge sharing behavior in the organizational context. The research model includes various constructs based on social exchange theory, self-efficacy, and theory of reasoned action. Research results from the field survey of 467 employees of four large, public organizations show that expected associations and contribution are the major determinants of the individual's attitude toward knowledge sharing. Expected rewards, believed by many to be the most important motivating factor for knowledge sharing, are not significantly related to the attitude toward knowledge sharing.

<doc><title>A decision support model for selecting product/service benefit positionings hinges on the firm's ability to select a set of attractively priced consumer benefits that are: valued by the buyer, distinctive in one or more respects, believable, deliverable, and sustainable (under actual or potential competitive abilities to imitate, neutralize, or overcome) in the target markets that the firm selects. For many years, the ubiquitous quadrant chart has been used to provide a simple graph of product/service benefits (usually called product/service attributes) described in terms of consumers' perceptions of the importance of attributes (to brand/supplier choice) and the performance of competing firms on these attributes. This paper describes a model that extends the quadrant chart concept to a decision support system that optimizes a firm's market share for a specified product/service. In particular, we describe a decision support model that utilizes relatively simple marketing research data on consumers' judged benefit importances, and supplier performances on these benefits to develop message components for specified target buyers. A case study is used to illustrate the model. The study deals with developing advertising message components for a relatively new entrant in the US air shipping market. We also discuss, more briefly, management reactions to application of the model to date, and areas for further research and model extension</title><text>The art (and science) of successful product/service positioning generally</text><keywords>product/service benefit positionings;decision support model;attractively priced consumer benefits;quadrant chart;simple graph;product/service attributes;brand/supplier choice;marketing research data;message components;advertising message components;US air shipping market;management reactions;advertising</keywords></doc>

A technical solution to maintaining privacy is to provide anonymity. We present a protocol for initiator anonymity called Hordes, which uses forwarding mechanisms similar to those used in previous protocols for sending data, but is the first protocol to make use of multicast routing to anonymously receive data. We show this results in shorter transmission latencies and requires less work of the protocol participants, in terms of the messages processed. We also present a comparison of the security and anonymity of Hordes with previous protocols, using the first quantitative definition of anonymity and unlinkability. Our analysis shows that Hordes provides anonymity in a degree similar to that of Crowds and Onion Routing, but also that Hordes has numerous performance advantages</title><text>With widespread acceptance of the Internet as a public medium for communication</text><keywords>Hordes;protocol;Internet;personal privacy;cooperating network entities;initiator anonymity;forwarding mechanisms;multicast routing;transmission latencies;unlinkability;Crowds;Onion Routing;performance</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>Adaptive thinning for bivariate scattered data of scattered data by piecewise linear functions over triangulated subsets. Our strategies depend on both the locations of the data points in the plane, and the values of the sampled function at these points - adaptive thinning. All our thinning strategies remove data points one by one, so as to minimize an estimate of the error that results by the removal of a point from the current set of points (this estimate is termed "anticipated error"). The thinning process generates subsets of "most significant" points, such that the piecewise linear interpolants over the Delaunay triangulations of these subsets approximate progressively the function values sampled at the original scattered points, and such that the approximation errors are small relative to the number of points in the subsets. We design various methods for computing the anticipated error at reasonable cost, and compare and test the performance of the methods. It is proved that for data sampled from a convex function, with the strategy of convex triangulation, the actual error is minimized by minimizing the best performing measure of anticipated error. It is also shown that for data sampled from certain quadratic polynomials, adaptive thinning is equivalent to thinning which depends only on the locations of the data points - nonadaptive thinning. Based on our numerical tests and comparisons, two practical adaptive thinning algorithms are proposed for thinning large data sets, one which is more accurate and another which is faster</title><text>This paper studies adaptive thinning strategies for approximating a large set</text><keywords>adaptive thinning;scattered data;piecewise linear functions;triangulated subsets;error;Delaunay triangulations;convex function</keywords></doc>
<doc><title>LR parsing for conjunctive grammars Tomita in 1986, is a polynomial-time implementation of nondeterministic LR parsing that uses graph-structured stack to represent the contents of the nondeterministic parser's pushdown for all possible branches of computation at a single computation step. It has been specifically developed as a solution for practical parsing tasks arising in computational linguistics, and indeed has proved itself to be very suitable for natural language processing. Conjunctive grammars extend context-free grammars by allowing the use of an explicit intersection operation within grammar rules. This paper develops a new LR-style parsing algorithm for these grammars, which is based on the very same idea of a graph-structured pushdown, where the simultaneous existence of several paths in the graph is used to perform the mentioned intersection operation. The underlying finite automata are treated in the most general way: instead of showing the algorithm's correctness for some particular way of constructing automata, the paper defines a wide class of automata usable with a given grammar, which includes not only the traditional LR(k) automata, but also, for instance, a trivial automaton with a single reachable state. A modification of the SLR(k) table construction method that makes use of specific properties of conjunctive grammars is provided as one possible way of making finite automata to use with the algorithm</title><text>The generalized LR parsing algorithm for context-free grammars, introduced by</text><keywords>conjunctive grammars;generalized LR parsing algorithm;graph-structured stack;computation;computational linguistics;natural language processing;context-free grammars;explicit intersection operation;grammar rules;finite automata;trivial automaton;single reachable state</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>An optimization based approach to the train operator scheduling problem at Singapore MRT of track and 48 stations. A total of 77 trains are in operation during peak hours and 41 during off-peak hours. We report on an optimization based approach to develop a computerized train-operator scheduling system that has been implemented at SMRT. The approach involves a bipartite matching algorithm for the generation of night duties and a tabu search algorithm for the generation of day duties. The system automates the train-operator scheduling process at SMRT and produces favorable schedules in comparison with the manual process. It is also able to handle the multiple objectives inherent in the crew scheduling system. While trying to minimize the system wide crew-related costs, the system is also able to address concern with respect to the number of split duties</title><text>Singapore Mass Rapid Transit (SMRT) operates two train lines with 83 kilometers</text><keywords>optimization based approach;Singapore Mass Rapid Transit;computerized train-operator scheduling system;bipartite matching algorithm;night duties;tabu search algorithm;day duties;crew scheduling system</keywords></doc>

In this paper, a fuzzy logic expert system approach was proposed as an innovative way to deal with the vagueness and complexity faced by medical doctors in kidney allocation decision making. A pilot fuzzy logic expert system for kidney allocation was developed and evaluated in comparison with two existing allocation algorithms: a priority sorting system used by multiple organ retrieval and exchange (MORE) in Canada and a point scoring systems used by united network for organ sharing (UNOS) in US. Our simulated experiment based on real data indicated that the fuzzy logic system can represent the expert's thinking well in handling complex tradeoffs, and overall, the fuzzy logic derived recommendations were more acceptable to the expert than those from the MORE and UNOS algorithms</title><text>Allocating donor kidneys to patients is a complex, multicriteria</text><keywords>renal transplantation assignment;fuzzy logic expert system;donor kidneys;kidney allocation decision making;priority sorting system;point scoring systems;united network for organ sharing;simulated experiment</keywords></doc>

Software comprehension is required in many parts of the maintenance process and is one of the most expensive activities. Many tools have been developed to help the maintainer reduce the time and cost of this task, but of the numerous tools and methods available one group has received relatively little attention: those using plausible reasoning to address the concept assignment problem. We present a concept assignment method for COBOL II: hypothesis-based concept assignment (HB-CA). An implementation of a prototype tool is described, and results from a comprehensive evaluation using commercial COBOL II sources are summarised.

<doc><title>Design of a stroke dependent damper for the front axle suspension of a truck using multibody system dynamics and numerical optimization The damper supplies extra damping for inward deflections rising above 4 cm. In this way the damper should reduce extreme suspension deflections without deteriorating the comfort of the truck. But the question is which stroke dependent damping curve yields the best compromise between suspension deflection working space and comfort. Therefore an optimization problem is defined to minimize the maximum inward suspension deflection subject to constraints on the chassis acceleration for three typical road undulations. The optimization problem is solved using sequential linear programming (SLP) and multibody dynamics simulation software. Several optimization runs have been carried out for a small two degree of freedom vehicle model and a large full-scale model of the truck semi-trailer combination. The results show that the stroke dependent damping can reduce large deflections at incidental road disturbances, but that the optimum stroke dependent damping curve is related to the acceleration bound. By means of vehicle model simulation and numerical optimization we have been able to quantify this trade-off between suspension deflection working space and truck comfort</title><text>A stroke dependent damper is designed for the front axle suspension of a truck.</text><keywords>stroke dependent damper;front axle suspension;multibody system dynamics;numerical optimization;inward deflections;extreme suspension deflections;chassis acceleration;road undulations;sequential linear programming;full-scale model;truck semi-trailer combination;damping;incidental road disturbances;acceleration bound;vehicle model simulation;truck comfort</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>DEVS simulation of distributed intrusion detection systems misuse, and abuse of computer and network systems. As intrusions become more sophisticated, dealing with them moves beyond the scope of one IDS. The need arises for systems to cooperate with one another, to manage diverse attacks across networks. The feature of recent attacks is that the packet delivery is moderately slow, and the attack sources and attack targets are distributed. These attacks are called "stealthy attacks." To detect these attacks, the deployment of distributed IDSs is needed. In such an environment, the ability of an IDS to share advanced information about these attacks is especially important. In this research, the IDS model exploits blacklist facts to detect the attacks that are based on either slow or highly distributed packets. To maintain the valid blacklist facts in the knowledge base of each IDS, the model should communicate with the other IDSs. When attack level goes beyond the interaction threshold, ID agents send interaction messages to ID agents in other hosts. Each agent model is developed as an interruptible atomic-expert model in which the expert system is embedded as a model component</title><text>An intrusion detection system (IDS) attempts to identify unauthorized use,</text><keywords>intrusion detection system;IDS;intrusions;expert system;distributed intrusion detection system</keywords></doc>

The extent to which developers and domain experts can comprehend these knowledge structures and gain useful insights into the basis of decision making has become a challenging research issue. This article examines the knowledge structures generated by the C4.5 induction technique in a fault diagnostic task and proposes to use a model of human learning in order to guide the process of making comprehensive the results of machine induction. The model of learning is used to generate hierarchical representations of diagnostic knowledge by adjusting the level of abstraction and varying the goal structures between 'shallow' and 'deep' ones. Comprehensibility is assessed in a global way in an experimental comparison where subjects are required to acquire the knowledge structures and transfer to new tasks. This method of addressing the issue of comprehensibility appears promising especially for machine induction techniques that are rather inflexible with regard to the number and sorts of interventions allowed to system developers</title><text>Machine induction has been extensively used in order to develop knowledge bases</text><keywords>experimental evaluation;induction techniques;case study;industrial fault diagnosis;knowledge bases;decision support systems;predictive systems;C4.5 induction technique</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>To commit or not to commit: modeling agent conversations for action conversations to be meaningful, agents ought to follow commonly known specifications limiting the types of messages that can be exchanged at any point in the conversation. These specifications are usually implemented using conversation policies (which are rules of inference) or conversation protocols (which are predefined conversation templates). In this article we present a semantic model for specifying conversations using conversation policies. This model is based on the principles that the negotiation and uptake of shared social commitments entail the adoption of obligations to action, which indicate the actions that agents have agreed to perform. In the same way, obligations are retracted based on the negotiation to discharge their corresponding shared social commitments. Based on these principles, conversations are specified as interaction specifications that model the ideal sequencing of agent participations negotiating the execution of actions in a joint activity. These specifications not only specify the adoption and discharge of shared commitments and obligations during an activity, but also indicate the commitments and obligations that are required (as preconditions) or that outlive a joint activity (as postconditions).

<doc><title>Parallel operation of capacity-limited three-phase four-wire active power filters paralleled to enlarge the system capacity and reliability. The APF employs the PWM four-leg voltage-source inverter. A decoupling control approach for the leg connected to the neutral line is proposed such that the switching of all legs has no interaction. Functions of the proposed APF include compensation of reactive power, harmonic current, unbalanced power and zero-sequence current of the load. The objective is to achieve unity power factor, balanced line current and zero neutral-line current. Compensation of all components is capacity-limited, co-operating with the cascaded load current sensing scheme.

<doc><title>Statistical analysis of nonlinearly reconstructed near-infrared tomographic images. II. Experimental interpretation a diffuse near-infrared tomography (NIR) system has been carried out on simulated data using a statistical approach described in pt. I of this paper (Pogue et al., 2002). The methodology is used here with experimental data acquired on phantoms with a prototype imaging system intended for characterizing breast tissue. Results show that imaging performance is not limited by random measurement error, but rather by calibration issues. The image error over the entire field of view is generally not minimized when an accurate homogeneous estimate of the phantom properties is available; however, local image error over a target region of interest (ROI) is reduced. The image reconstruction process which includes a Levenberg-Marquardt style regularization provides good minimization of the objective function, yet its reduction is not always correlated with an overall image error decrease. Minimization of the bias in an ROI which contains localized changes in the optical properties can be achieved through five to nine iterations of the algorithm. Precalibration of the algorithm through statistical evaluation of phantom studies may provide a better measure of the image accuracy than that implied by minimization of the standard objective function</title><text>For pt.

<doc><title>Cultural differences in developers' perceptions of information systems success factors: Japan vs. the United States Japan and the United States regarding the strategies that are considered most important for successful implementation of an IS. The results of principal component analysis revealed that the IS strategies could be reduced to five components: (1) characteristics of the team members, (2) characteristics of the project leader, (3) management/user input, (4) proper technology, and (5) communication. The results indicated that there was a significant difference in the perceptions of Japanese and US developers with respect to the importance of the five components. Japanese developers perceived the project leader as the most crucial component for determining the success of an IS project. Team member characteristics was viewed as the least important by Japanese developers. On the other hand, developers from the US viewed communications as the most critical component. Project leader characteristics were perceived to be the least important by US developers.

<doc><title>The effects of work pace on within-participant and between-participant keying force, electromyography, and fatigue typing force, electromyographic (EMG) activity, and subjective discomfort. We found that as participants typed faster, their typing force and finger flexor and extensor EMG activity increased linearly. There was also an increase in subjective discomfort, with a sharp threshold between participants' self-selected pace and their maximum typing speed. The results suggest that participants self-select a typing pace that maximizes typing speed and minimizes discomfort. The fastest typists did not produce significantly more finger flexor EMG activity but did produce proportionately less finger extensor EMG activity compared with the slower typists. We hypothesize that fast typists may use different muscle recruitment patterns that allow them to be more efficient than slower typists at striking the keys. In addition, faster typists do not experience more discomfort than slow typists. These findings show that the relative pace of typing is more important than actual typing speed with regard to discomfort and muscle activity. These results suggest that typists may benefit from skill training to increase maximum typing speed. Potential applications of this research includes skill training for typists</title><text>A laboratory study was conducted to determine the effects of work pace on</text><keywords>EMG activity;subjective discomfort;finger flexor;typing speed;discomfort;typists;muscle recruitment patterns;keying force;skill training</keywords></doc>
<doc><title>Organizational design, information transfer, and the acquisition of rent-producing resources which the knowledge accumulated over the history of a firm and embedded in organizational routines and structures influences the firm's ability to recognize the value of new resources and capabilities. This paper explores the possibility of firms to select organizational designs that increase the likelihood that they will recognize and value rent-producing resources and capabilities. A computational model is developed to study the tension between an organization's desire to explore its environment for new capabilities and the organization's need to exploit existing capabilities. Support is provided for the proposition that integration, both externally and internally, is an important source of dynamic capability. The model provides greater insight into the tradeoffs between these two forms of integration and suggests when one form may be preferred over another. In particular, evidence is provided that in uncertain environments, the ability to explore possible alternatives is critical while in more certain environments, the ability to transfer information internally is paramount</title><text>Within the resource-based view of the firm, a dynamic story has emerged in</text><keywords>organizational design;information transfer;rent-producing resources;computational model;uncertain environments;certain environments</keywords></doc>

This paper addresses the design and development of a CD-ROM learning resource for food and beverage. It is a learning resource which is designed to integrate with rather than to replace existing conventional classroom and laboratory learning methods and, thus, compensate for the decline in the resource base faced in food and beverage education in recent years.

<doc><title>An optimization approach to plan for reusable software components for accomplishing significant productivity improvements through the implementation of a successful software reuse program. On the other hand, such gains are attainable only by instituting detailed action plans at both the organizational and program level. Given this need, the paucity of research papers related to planning, and in particular, optimized planning is surprising. This research, which is aimed at this gap, brings out an application of optimization for the planning of reusable software components (SCs). We present a model that selects a set of SCs that must be built, in order to lower development and adaptation costs. We also provide implications to project management based on simulation, an approach that has been adopted by other cost models in the software engineering literature.

While intercepting and flying the pathway, pilots were required to watch for traffic outside the cockpit. Additionally, pilots were tested on their awareness of speed, altitude, and heading during the flight. Results indicated that the presence of a flight guidance cue significantly improved flight path awareness while intercepting the pathway, but significant practice effects suggest that a guidance cue might be unnecessary if pilots are given proper training. The amount of time spent looking outside the cockpit while using the HITS display was significantly less than when using conventional aircraft instruments. Additionally, awareness of flight information present on the HITS display was poor.

<doc><title>A uniform framework for regulating service access and information release on the Web information (such as user profiles) that clients are required to disclose. This information demand is necessary for regulating access to services, and functionally convenient (e.g., to support service customization), but it has raised privacy-related concerns which, if not addressed, may affect the users disposition to use network services. At the same time, servers need to regulate service access without disclosing entirely the details of their access control policy. There is therefore a pressing need for privacy-aware techniques to regulate access to services open to the network. We propose an approach for regulating service access and information disclosure on the Web. The approach consists of a uniform formal framework to formulate - and reason about - both service access and information disclosure constraints. It also provides a means for parties to communicate their requirements while ensuring that no private information be disclosed and that the communicated requirements are correct with respect to the constraints</title><text>The widespread use of Internet-based services is increasing the amount of</text><keywords>information release;user profiles;information demand;access control policy;privacy-aware techniques;network services;information disclosure;uniform formal framework;reasoning</keywords></doc>
<doc><title>Robustness evaluation of a minimal RBF neural network for nonlinear-data-storage-channel equalisation developed minimal resource allocation network (MRAN) for equalisation in highly nonlinear magnetic recording channels in disc storage systems. Unlike communication systems, equalisation of signals in these channels is a difficult problem, as they are corrupted by data-dependent noise and highly nonlinear distortions. Nair and Moon (1997) have proposed a maximum signal to distortion ratio (MSDR) equaliser for data storage channels, which uses a specially designed neural network, where all the parameters of the neural network are determined theoretically, based on the exact knowledge of the channel model parameters. In the present paper, the performance of the MSDR equaliser is compared with that of the MRAN equaliser using a magnetic recording channel model, under Conditions that include variations in partial erasure, jitter, width and noise power, as well as model mismatch. Results from the study indicate that the less complex MRAN equaliser gives consistently better performance robustness than the MSDR equaliser in terms of signal to distortion ratios (SDRs)</title><text>The authors present a performance-robustness evaluation of the recently</text><keywords>robustness evaluation;minimal resource allocation network;highly nonlinear magnetic recording channels;disc storage systems;nonlinear-data-storage-channel equalisation;data-dependent noise;highly nonlinear distortions;RBF neural network;MRAN equaliser;MSDR equaliser</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>Pulmonary perfusion patterns and pulmonary arterial pressure parameters describing the perfusion image can be synthesized to make a reasonable estimate of the pulmonary arterial (PA) pressure measured at angiography. Radionuclide perfusion images were obtained in 120 patients with normal chest radiographs who also underwent angiographic PA pressure measurement within 3 days of the radionuclide study. An artificial neural network (ANN) was constructed from several image parameters describing statistical and boundary characteristics of the perfusion images. With use of a leave-one-out cross-validation technique, this method was used to predict the PA systolic pressure in cases on which the ANN had not been trained. A Pearson correlation coefficient was determined between the predicted and measured PA systolic pressures. ANN predictions correlated with measured pulmonary systolic pressures (r=0.846, P<.001). The accuracy of the predictions was not influenced by the presence of pulmonary embolism. None of the 51 patients with predicted PA pressures of less than 29 mm Hg had pulmonary hypertension at angiography. All 13 patients with predicted PA pressures greater than 48 mm Hg had pulmonary hypertension at angiography. Meaningful information regarding PA pressure can be derived from noninvasive radionuclide perfusion scanning.

One hundred and sixty-four physicians formed project groups to process the requests and responded using email. The distribution of patients using the service was similar to the availability of the Internet: 78% were from the European Union, North America and Australia. Sixty-seven per cent of the patients lived in urban areas and the remainder were residents of remote rural areas with limited local medical coverage. Sixty-five per cent of the requests were about problems of internal medicine and 30% of the requests concerned surgical issues. The remaining 5% of the patients sought information about recent developments, such as molecular medicine or aviation medicine.

A study which has been carried out by the institute, identifies viral messages as a new paradigm of communication, mostly found in the area of Direct Marketing, and - who wonders - mainly within the USA. Viral messages underlie certain principles: (1) prospects and customers of the idea are offered a technology platform providing a possibility to send a message to a majority of persons; (2) there is an emotional or pecuniary incentive to participate. Ideally, niches of needs and market vacua are filled with funny ideas; (3) also, the recipients are facing emotional or pecuniary incentives to contact a majority of further recipients - this induces a snowball effect and the message is spread virally; and (4) the customer is activated as an "ambassador" of the piece of information, for instance promoting a product or a company. It is evident that there has been a long lasting history of what we call "word-of-mouth" ever since, however bundles of digital technologies empower the viral communication paradigm</title><text>The IIW Institute of Information Management (www.IIW.de) is dealing with</text><keywords>viral communication paradigm;commercial applications;viral messages;Internet;direct marketing</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>Minimised geometric Buchberger algorithm for integer programming based on the theory of Grobner bases. The main difficulty of these solvers is the size of the Grobner bases generated. In algorithms proposed so far, large Grobner bases are generated by either introducing additional variables or by considering the generic IP problem IP/sub A,C/. Some improvements have been proposed such as Hosten and Sturmfels' method (GRIN) designed to avoid additional variables and Thomas' truncated Grobner basis method which computes the reduced Grobner basis for a specific IP problem IP/sub A,C/(b) (rather than its generalisation IPA,C). In this paper we propose a new algebraic algorithm for solving IP problems. The new algorithm, called Minimised Geometric Buchberger Algorithm, combines Hosten and Sturmfels' GRIN and Thomas' truncated Grobner basis method to compute the fundamental segments of an IP problem IP/sub A,C/ directly in its original space and also the truncated Grobner basis for a specific IP problem IP/sub A,C/ (b). We have carried out experiments to compare this algorithm with others such as the geometric Buchberger algorithm, the truncated geometric Buchberger algorithm and the algorithm in GRIN.

The new scheme approaches the congestion control problem from a control-theoretical perspective and overcomes several Important limitations associated with existing TCP congestion control schemes, which are heuristic based. In the proposed scheme, a PD controller is employed to keep the buffer occupancy of the bottleneck node on the connection path at an ideal operating level, and it adjusts the TCP window accordingly. The control gains of the PD controller are tuned online by a fuzzy logic controller based on the perceived bandwidth-delay product of the TCP connection. This scheme gives ST-PD TCP several advantages over current TCP implementations. These include rapid response to bandwidth variations, insensitivity to buffer sizes, and significant improvement of TCP throughput over lossy links by decoupling congestion control and error control functions of TCP</title><text>A novel self-tuning proportional and derivative (ST-PD) control based TCP</text><keywords>TCP congestion control scheme;performance evaluation;control-theoretical perspective;PD controller;buffer occupancy;bottleneck node;connection path;fuzzy logic controller;bandwidth-delay product;lossy links</keywords></doc>

For a noncomputer science-minded reader, we shall use the metaphore of n cars parking on m places: each car c/sub i/ chooses a place p/sub i/ at random, and if p/sub i/ is occupied, c/sub i/ tries successively p/sub i/+1, p/sub i/+2, until it finds an empty place. Pittel [42] proves that when l/m goes to some positive limit beta <1, the size B/sub 1//sup m,l/ of the largest block of consecutive cars satisfies 2( beta -1-log beta ) B/sub 1//sup m,l/=2 log m-3 log log m+ Xi /sub m/, where Xi /sub m/ converges weakly to an extreme-value distribution. In this paper we examine at which level for n a phase transition occurs between B/sub 1//sup m,l/=o(m) and m-B/sub 1//sup m,l/=o(m).

Three shapes were used: square, circle and irregularly round. The main experiment, with slanted figures, involved only two shapes-square and irregularly shaped-showed at several slant degrees. Despite the accumulated evidence for shape constancy when the outline of perspective projections is considered, metric perception of the inner structure of such projections was quite limited. Systematic distortions were found, especially with more extreme slants, and attributed to the joint effect of several factors: anchors, 3D information, and slant underestimation.

A concept less restrictive than STLC, termed the small-time local output controllability (STLOC) is introduced, the satisfaction of which guarantees that a chosen configuration output can be controlled at its desired value.

In the paper, the dependence theory is extended to describe multiagent links, with a special reference to group and collective phenomena, and is proposed as a framework for the study of emerging social structures, such as groups and collectives. In order to do so, we propose to extend the notion of dependence networks (applied to a single agent) to dependence graphs (applied to an agency).

The same gap can be observed at the college level where males are dominating females as to those who pursue and obtain a degree in computer science. The question that this research paper intends to show is: why are males so dominant when it comes to computer related matters? The author has traced this question back to the computer game. Computer games are a fun medium and provide the means for an individual to become computer literate through the engagement of spatial learning and cognitive processing abilities. Since such games are marketed almost exclusively to males, females have a distinct disadvantage. Males are more computer literate through the playing of computer games, and are provided with an easy lead-in to more advanced utilization of computers such as programming. Females tend to be turned off due to the male stereotypes and marketing associated with games and thus begins the gender gap</title><text>If careers in the computer industry were viewed, it would be evident that there</text><keywords>careers;computer industry;gender gap;computer games;female employees;spatial learning;cognitive processing;male stereotypes;marketing</keywords></doc>

Thus, in our multi-level approach, accurate higher order finite element discretisations can be combined with fast multi-level solvers based on lower order (nonconforming) finite element discretisations. This leads to the design of efficient multi-level solvers for higher order finite element discretisations</title><text>We consider a general framework for analysing the convergence of multi-grid</text><keywords>non-nested multi-level solvers;finite element discretisations;mixed problems;higher order finite element discretisations;multi-level solvers</keywords></doc>
<doc><title>Technology on social issues of videoconferencing on the Internet: a survey protocol as well as fast improvement in computing devices (e.g. higher speed, larger memory) have set forth the opportunity to have resource demanding videoconferencing (VC) sessions on the Internet. Multicast is supported by the multicast backbone (Mbone), which is a special portion of the Internet where this protocol is being deployed. Mbone VC tools are steadily emerging and the user population is growing fast. VC is a fascinating application that has the potential to greatly impact the way we remotely communicate and work. Yet, the adoption of VC is not as fast as one could have predicted. Hence, it is important to examine the factors that affect a widespread adoption of VC. This paper examines the enabling technology and the social issues. It discusses the achievements and identifies the future challenges. It suggests an integration of many emerging multimedia tools into VC in order to enhance its versatility for more effectiveness</title><text>Constant advances in audio/video compression, the development of the multicast</text><keywords>videoconferencing;Internet;multicast backbone;Mbone;multimedia;social issues</keywords></doc>

The input dynamical uncertainty is restricted to be minimum-phase and relative degree zero. A sufficient condition. is given such that the nonlinear system satisfies the L/sub 2/ gain performance and input-to-state stable property. Using this condition, a design approach is given for a smooth state feedback control law that solves the robust L/sub 2/ disturbance attenuation problem, and the approach is extended to a more general case where the nominal system has higher relative degree.

<doc><title>Computing grid unlocks research Technology was allocated Pounds 98m to establish a three year e-science research and development programme. The programme has a bold vision: to change the dynamic of the way science is undertaken. The term 'e-science' was introduced by John Taylor, director general of research councils in the Office of Science and Technology. He saw many areas of science becoming increasingly reliant on new ways of collaborative, multidisciplinary, interorganisation working. E-science is intended to capture these new modes of working. There are two major components to the programme: the science, and the infrastructure to support that science. The infrastructure is generally referred to as the Grid. The choice of name resonates with the idea of a future in which computing resources and storage, as well as expensive scientific facilities and software, can be accessed on demand, like electricity.

<doc><title>A heuristic approach to resource locations in broadband networks resources is increasing because of its potential to improve performance especially for transaction processing. In environments with migratory data resources, it is necessary to have mechanisms to manage the locations of each data resource. In this paper, we present an algorithm that makes use of system state information and heuristics to manage locations of data resources in a distributed network. In the proposed algorithm, each site maintains information about state of other sites with respect to each data resource of the system and uses it to find: (1) a subset of sites likely to have the requested data resource; and (2) the site where the data resource is to be migrated from the current site. The proposed algorithm enhances its effectiveness by continuously updating system state information stored at each site. It focuses on reducing the overall average time delay needed by the transaction requests to locate and access the migratory data resources. We evaluated the performance of the proposed algorithm and also compared it with one of the existing location management algorithms, by simulation studies under several system parameters such as the frequency of requests generation, frequency of data resource migrations, network topology and scale of network. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in all cases</title><text>In broadband networks, such as ATM, the importance of dynamic migration of data</text><keywords>broadband networks;ATM;resource locations;heuristics;distributed network;data resource migrations;network topology</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>The BLISS programming language: a history Carnegie-Mellon University in 1969, originally for the DEC PDP-10. BLISS-10 caught the interest of Ronald F. Brender of DEC (Digital Equipment Corporation). After several years of collaboration, including the creation of BLISS-11 for the PDP-11, BLISS was adopted as DEC's implementation language for use on its new line of VAX computers in 1975. DEC developed a completely new generation of BLISSs for the VAX, PDP-10 and PDP-11, which became widely used at DEC during the 1970s and 1980s. With the creation of the Alpha architecture in the early 1990s, BLISS was extended again, in both 32- and 64-bit flavors. BLISS support for the Intel IA-32 architecture was introduced in 1995 and IA-64 support is now in progress. BLISS has a number of unusual characteristics: it is typeless, requires use of an explicit contents of operator (written as a period or 'dot'), takes an algorithmic approach to data structure definition, has no goto, is an expression language, and has an unusually rich compile-time language. This paper reviews the evolution and use of BLISS over its three decade lifetime. Emphasis is on how the language evolved to facilitate portable programming while retaining its initial highly machine-specific character. Finally, the success of its characteristics are assessed</title><text>The BLISS programming language was invented by William A.

Patients who consented were randomly assigned to one of two groups. One group received services in person (FTF from the visiting psychiatrist) while the other was seen using videoconferencing at 128 kbit/s. One psychiatrist provided all the FTF and videoconferencing assessment and follow-up visits. A total of 24 subjects were recruited. Three of the subjects (13%) did not attend their appointments and two subjects in each group were lost to follow-up. Thus there were nine in the FTF group and eight in the videoconferencing group. The two groups were similar in most respects. Patient satisfaction with the services was assessed using the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8), completed four months after the initial consultation. The mean scores were 25.3 in the FTF group and 21.6 in the videoconferencing group. Although there was a trend in favour of the FTF service, the difference was not significant. Patient satisfaction is only one component of evaluation. The efficacy of telepsychiatry must also be measured relative to that of conventional, FTF care before policy makers can decide how extensively telepsychiatry should be implemented</title><text>We carried out a pilot study comparing satisfaction levels between psychiatric</text><keywords>client satisfaction;face-to-face interviews;telepsychiatry;videoconference;Client Satisfaction Questionnaire</keywords></doc>

Theory and simulations interior of tissues to quantify concentrations of hemoglobin and exogenous chromophores noninvasively in vivo. It often exploits an optical diffusion model-based image reconstruction algorithm to estimate spatial property values from measurements of the light flux at the surface of the tissue. In this study, mean-squared error (MSE) over the image is used to evaluate methods for regularizing the ill-posed inverse image reconstruction problem in NIR tomography. Estimates of image bias and image standard deviation were calculated based upon 100 repeated reconstructions of a test image with randomly distributed noise added to the light flux measurements. It was observed that the bias error dominates at high regularization parameter values while variance dominates as the algorithm is allowed to approach the optimal solution. This optimum does not necessarily correspond to the minimum projection error solution, but typically requires further iteration with a decreasing regularization parameter to reach the lowest image error. Increasing measurement noise causes a need to constrain the minimum regularization parameter to higher values in order to achieve a minimum in the overall image MSE</title><text>Near-infrared (NIR) diffuse tomography is an emerging method for imaging the</text><keywords>hemoglobin;optical diffusion model-based image reconstruction algorithm;decreasing regularization parameter;lowest image error;bias error;optimal solution;light flux;mean-squared error;test image;randomly distributed noise</keywords></doc>

The framework involves the construction of a generic image feature extraction library, from which the feature extractors that are most relevant to the visual assessment by domain experts are determined automatically through factor analysis. The dynamics of the visual search are analyzed by using the Markov model for providing training information to novices on how and where to look for image features. The validity of the framework has been evaluated in a clinical scenario whereby the pulmonary vascular distribution on Computed Tomography images was assessed by experienced radiologists as a potential indicator of heart failure. The performance of the system has been demonstrated by training four novices to follow the visual assessment behavior of two experienced observers.

<doc><title>Product development: using a 3D computer model to optimize the stability of the Rocket TM powered wheelchair created to aid the development of the Rocket prototype wheelchair and to help explore the effect of innovative design features on its stability. The model was developed using simulation software, specifically Working Model 3D. The accuracy of the model was determined by comparing both its static stability angles and dynamic behavior as it passed down a 4.8-cm (1.9") road curb at a heading of 45 degrees with the performance of the actual wheelchair. The model's predictions of the static stability angles in the forward, rearward, and lateral directions were within 9.3, 7.1, and 3.8% of the measured values, respectively. The average absolute error in the predicted position of the wheelchair as it moved down the curb was 2.2 cm/m (0.9" per 3'3") traveled. The accuracy was limited by the inability to model soft bodies, the inherent difficulties in modeling a statically indeterminate system, and the computing time. Nevertheless, it was found to be useful in investigating the effect of eight design alterations on the lateral stability of the wheelchair. Stability was quantified by determining the static lateral stability angles and the maximum height of a road curb over which the wheelchair could successfully drive on a diagonal heading. The model predicted that the stability was more dependent on the configuration of the suspension system than on the dimensions and weight distribution of the wheelchair. Furthermore, for the situations and design alterations studied, predicted improvements in static stability were not correlated with improvements in dynamic stability</title><text>A three-dimensional (3D) lumped-parameter model of a powered wheelchair was</text><keywords>3D computer model;product development;innovative design features;average absolute error;predicted position;statically indeterminate system;computing time;diagonal heading;weight distribution;Rocket TM powered wheelchair</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>On a general constitutive description for the inelastic and failure behavior of fibrous laminates. II. Laminate theory and applications constitutive description for the inelastic and strength behavior of laminated composites reinforced with various fiber preforms. The constitutive relationship is established micromechanically, through layer-by-layer analysis. Namely, only the properties of the constituent fiber and matrix materials of the composites are required as input data. In the previous part lamina theory was presented. Three fundamental quantities of the laminae, i.e. the internal stresses generated in the constituent fiber and matrix materials and the instantaneous compliance matrix, with different fiber preform (including woven, braided, and knitted fabric) reinforcements were explicitly obtained by virtue of the bridging micromechanics model. In this paper, the laminate stress analysis is shown. The purpose of this analysis is to determine the load shared by each lamina in the laminate, so that the lamina theory can be applied. Incorporation of the constitutive equations into an FEM software package is illustrated. A number of application examples are given to demonstrate the efficiency of the constitutive theory. The predictions made include: failure envelopes of multidirectional laminates subjected to biaxial in-plane loads, thermomechanical cycling stress-strain curves of a titanium metal matrix composite laminate, S-N curves of multilayer knitted fabric reinforced laminates under tensile fatigue, and bending load-deflection plots and ultimate bending strengths of laminated braided fabric reinforced beams subjected to lateral loads</title><text>For pt.

Although the ubiquitous nature of technology has brought the various work responsibilities of academic and public librarians closer together during the last decade, there remain key differences in job-related duties and the work environments.

A computer based stochastic simulation model that accurately represents the selection was developed. The paper describes the simulation model, showing its accuracy as well as how a combination of dynamic programming and branch and bound can be applied to the model to optimise the selection system, giving a new application of these techniques.

To make the consensus of the experts consistent, we utilize the fuzzy Delphi method to adjust the fuzzy rating of every expert to achieve the consensus condition. For the aggregate of many experts' opinions, we take the operation of fuzzy numbers to get the mean of fuzzy rating, x/sub ij/ and the mean of weight, w/sub .j/. In multi-alternatives and multi-attributes cases, the fuzzy decision matrix X=[x/sub ij/]/sub m*n/ is constructed by means of the fuzzy rating, x/sub ij/. Then, we can derive the aggregate fuzzy numbers by multiplying the fuzzy decision matrix with the corresponding fuzzy attribute weights. The final results become a problem of ranking fuzzy numbers. We also propose an easy procedure of using fuzzy numbers to rank aggregate fuzzy numbers A/sub i/. In this way, we can obtain the best selection for evaluating the system.

<doc><title>Control performance with three translational degrees of freedom accurately operators can control each DOF and what influence perceptual, information processing, and psychomotor components have on performance. Sixteen right-handed male students participated in 2 experiments: 1 involving positioning and 1 involving tracking with 3 translational DOFs. To separate perceptual and psychomotor effects, we used 2 control-display mappings that differed in the coupling of vertical and depth dimensions to the up-down and fore-aft control axes. We observed information processing effects in the positioning task: Initial error correction on the vertical dimension lagged in time behind the horizontal dimension. The depth dimension error correction lagged behind both, which was ascribed to the poorer perceptual information. We observed this perceptual effect also in the tracking experiment. Motor effects were also present, with tracking errors along the up-down axis of the hand controller being 1.1 times larger than along the fore-aft axis. These results indicate that all 3 components contribute to control performance. Actual applications of this research include interface design</title><text>For multiple degree-of-freedom (DOF) systems, it is important to determine how</text><keywords>control performance;positioning;tracking;perceptual effects;psychomotor effects;initial error correction;depth dimension error correction;interface design</keywords></doc>
<doc><title>Neural and neuro-fuzzy integration in a knowledge-based system for air quality prediction in neurosymbolic systems as a combination of neural and neuro-fuzzy modules. In the developed hybrid system, a training data set is used for building neuro-fuzzy modules, and represents implicit domain knowledge. The explicit domain knowledge on the other hand is represented by fuzzy rules, which are directly mapped into equivalent neural structures. The aim of this approach is to improve the abilities of modular neural structures, which are based on incomplete learning data sets, since the knowledge acquired from human experts is taken into account for adapting the general neural architecture. Three methods to combine the explicit and implicit knowledge modules are proposed. The techniques used to extract fuzzy rules from neural implicit knowledge modules are described. These techniques improve the structure and the behavior of the entire system. The proposed methodology has been applied in the field of air quality prediction with very encouraging results. These experiments show that the method is worth further investigation</title><text>We propose a unified approach for integrating implicit and explicit knowledge</text><keywords>neuro-fuzzy integration;knowledge-based system;air quality prediction;neurosymbolic systems;hybrid system;training data set;fuzzy rules;incomplete learning;neural architecture;experiments</keywords></doc>

Such curves form a subset of rational Bezier curves characterized by control points on radial directions regularly spaced with respect to the polar angle, and weights equal to the inverse of the polar radius. We show that this subset encompasses several classical sectrix curves, which solve geometrically the problem of dividing an angle into equal spans, and also spirals defining the trajectories of particles in central fields. First, we identify as p-Bezier curves a family of sinusoidal spirals that includes Tschirnhausen's cubic. Second, the trisectrix of Maclaurin and their generalizations, called arachnidas.

<doc><title>An algorithm combining neural networks with fundamental parameters equations (NNFP) is proposed for making corrections for non-linear matrix effects in x-ray fluorescence analysis. In the algorithm, neural networks were applied to relate the concentrations of components to both the measured intensities and the relative theoretical intensities calculated by the fundamental parameter equations. The NNFP algorithm is compared with the classical theoretical correction models, including the fundamental parameters approach, the Lachance-Traill model, a hyperbolic function model and the COLA algorithm. For an alloy system with 15 measured elements, in most cases, the prediction errors of the NNFP algorithm are lower than those of the fundamental parameters approach, the Lachance-Traill model, the hyperbolic function model and the COLA algorithm separately. If there are the serious matrix effects, such as matrix effects among Cr, Fe and Ni, the NNFP algorithm generally decreased predictive errors as compared with the classical models, except for the case of Cr by the fundamental parameters approach. The main reason why the NNFP algorithm has generally a better predictive ability than the classical theoretical correction models might be that neural networks can better calibrate the non-linear matrix effects in a complex multivariate system</title><text>An algorithm combining neural networks with the fundamental parameters</text><keywords>algorithm;neural networks;fundamental parameters;fundamental parameters equations;x-ray fluorescence analysis;intensities;NNFP algorithm;theoretical correction models;Lachance-Traill model;hyperbolic function model;COLA algorithm;alloy system;Cr;Fe;Ni;complex multivariate system</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>Optimal multi-degree reduction of Bezier curves with constraints of endpoints continuity (degree reduction of more than one degree) by a Bezier curve of degree m (m<n-1) with constraints of endpoint continuity is investigated. With respect to L/sub 2/ norm, this paper presents an approximate method (MDR by L/sub 2/) that gives an explicit solution to deal with it. The method has good properties of endpoint interpolation: continuity of any r, s (r, s>or=0) orders can be preserved at two endpoints respectively. The method in the paper performs multi-degree reduction at one time and does not need stepwise computing. When applied to multi-degree reduction with endpoint continuity of any order, the MDR by L/sub 2/ obtains the best least squares approximation. Comparison with another method of multi-degree reduction (MDR by L/sub infinity /), which achieves the nearly best uniform approximation with respect to L/sub infinity / norm, is also given. The approximate effect of the MDR by L/sub 2/ is better than that of the MDR by L/sub infinity /.

<doc><title>Well-posed anisotropic diffusion for image denoising differential equation is introduced. It smooths out the image according to an anisotropic diffusion process. The approach is based on a smooth approximation of the total variation (TV) functional which overcomes the non-differentiability of the TV functional at the origin. In particular, the authors perform linear smoothing over smooth areas but selective smoothing over candidate edges. By relating the smoothing parameter to the time step, they arrive at a CFL condition which guarantees the causality of the discrete scheme. This allows the adoption of higher time discretisation steps, while ensuring the absence of artefacts deriving from the non-smooth behaviour of the TV functional at the origin. In particular, it is shown that the proposed approach avoids the typical staircase effects in smooth areas which occur in the standard time-marching TV scheme</title><text>A nonlinear iterative smoothing filter based on a second-order partial</text><keywords>image denoising;well-posed anisotropic diffusion;nonlinear iterative smoothing filter;linear smoothing;selective smoothing;CFL condition;discrete scheme;causality;higher time discretisation steps</keywords></doc>
<doc><title>On a general constitutive description for the inelastic and failure behavior of fibrous laminates. I. Lamina theory accomplished based on a stress failure criterion. This is, however, generally not true with laminated composites. Only when the laminate is subjected to an in-plane load, can the ultimate failure of the laminate correspond to its last-ply failure, and hence a stress failure criterion may be sufficient to detect the maximum load that can be sustained by the laminate. Even in such a case, the load shared by each lamina in the laminate cannot be correctly determined if the lamina instantaneous stiffness matrix is inaccurately provided, since the lamina is always statically indeterminate in the laminate. If, however, the laminate is subjected to a lateral load, its ultimate failure occurs before last-ply failure and use of the stress failure criterion is no longer sufficient; an additional critical deflection or curvature condition must also be employed. This necessitates development of an efficient constitutive relationship for laminated composites in order that the laminate strains/deflections up to ultimate failure can be accurately calculated. A general constitutive description for the thermomechanical response of a fibrous laminate up to ultimate failure with applications to various fibrous laminates is presented in the two papers. The constitutive relationship is obtained by combining classical lamination theory with a recently developed bridging micromechanics model, through a layer-by-layer analysis.

<doc><title>Exploring the sabbatical or other leave as a means of energizing a career professional growth but also renewal. It presents a framework for developing a successful leave, incorporating useful advice from librarians at Concordia University (Montreal). As food for thought, the article offers examples of specific options meant to encourage professionals to explore their own creative ideas. Finally, a central theme of this article is that a midlife leave provides one with the perfect opportunity to take stock of oneself in order to define future career directions. Midlife is a time when rebel forces, feisty protestors from within, often insist on being heard. It is a time, in other words, when professionals often long to break loose from the stress "to do far more, in less time" (Barner, 1994). Escaping from current job constraints into a world of creative endeavor, when well-executed, is a superb means of invigorating a career stuck in gear and discovering a fresh perspective from which to view one's profession. To ignite renewal, midcareer is the perfect time to grant one's imagination free reign</title><text>This article challenges librarians to create leaves that will not only inspire</text><keywords>career;librarians;professional growth;midlife leave</keywords></doc>

The proposed method provides close matching of the states between the original continuous-time system and those of the digitally redesigned system with a guaranteed stability. Specifically, the digital redesign problem is reformulated as linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) and solved by a numerical optimisation technique. The main feature of the proposed method is that the closed-loop stability of the digitally redesigned system is explicitly guaranteed within the design procedure using the LMI-based approach.

To test two hypotheses concerning the validity of the conceptual model and two human-centred features, an experiment was conducted with 30 subjects. Testing of the two hypotheses indicated the following: (1) the memory structure map's users showed 29% better performance in navigation, and (2) the history-based tool's users outperformed by 34% in identifying information.

<doc><title>A GRASP heuristic for the mixed Chinese postman problem satisfying some conditions related to the links of the graph. In the Chinese postman problem (CPP) the aim is to find a minimum cost tour (closed walk) traversing all the links of the graph at least once. Both the Undirected CPP, where all the links are edges that can be traversed in both ways, and the Directed CPP, where all the links are arcs that must be traversed in a specified way, are known to be polynomially solvable. However, if we deal with a mixed graph (having edges and arcs), the problem turns out to be NP-hard. In this paper, we present a heuristic algorithm for this problem, the so-called Mixed CPP (MCPP), based on greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP) techniques. The algorithm has been tested and compared with other known and recent methods from the literature on a wide collection of randomly generated instances, with up to 200 nodes and 600 links, producing encouraging computational results. As far as we know, this is the best heuristic algorithm for the MCPP, with respect to solution quality, published up to now</title><text>Arc routing problems (ARPs) consist of finding a traversal on a graph</text><keywords>mixed Chinese postman problem;GRASP heuristic;arc routing problems;minimum cost tour;closed walk;heuristic algorithm;greedy randomized adaptive search procedure</keywords></doc>

<doc><title>Relation between glare and driving performance behavior. Participants (old and young; US and Europeans) were exposed to a simulated low- beam light source mounted on the hood of an instrumented vehicle. Participants drove at night in actual traffic along a track consisting of urban, rural, and highway stretches. The results show that the relatively low glare source caused a significant drop in detecting simulated pedestrians along the roadside and made participants drive significantly slower on dark and winding roads. Older participants showed the largest drop in pedestrian detection performance and reduced their driving speed the most. The results indicate that the de Boer rating scale, the most commonly used rating scale for discomfort glare, is practically useless as a predictor of driving performance. Furthermore, the maximum US headlamp intensity (1380 cd per headlamp) appears to be an acceptable upper limit</title><text>The present study investigated the effects of discomfort glare on driving</text><keywords>glare;driving performance;discomfort glare;highway</keywords></doc>
<doc><title>Differential and integral calculus on discrete time series data (Lin 1998). In this presentation, we will generalize the idea of integration and differentiation, we developed in calculus, to the study of time series in the hope that the problem of outliers and discontinuities can be resolved more successfully than simply deleting the outliers and avoiding discontinuities from the overall data analysis. In general, appearances of outliers tend to mean existence of discontinuities, explosive growth or decline in the evolution. At the same time, our approach can be employed to partially overcome the problem of not having enough data values in any available time series. At the end, we will look at some real-life problems of prediction in order to see the power of this new approach</title><text>It has been found that discontinuity plays a crucial role in natural evolutions</text><keywords>natural evolutions;integration;differentiation;time series;outliers;prediction</keywords></doc>
